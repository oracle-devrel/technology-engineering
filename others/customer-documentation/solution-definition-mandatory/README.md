# Solution Definition (Mandatory)
 
Welcome to the Solution Definition template. It is a document structure describing pre-sales documentation for customers embarking on their cloud journey. 

The intent is to provide a high-quality piece of documentation, improving the implementation time for customers and partners, and resulting in quicker business benefit realization of the proposed solution.

The template comes in two flavors: ‘Mandatory’ or ‘Complete’. The mandatory version is smaller and includes the minimum required chapters for an Oracle solution. The complete version includes more chapters for optional content that might be situational relevant from project to project.

Please feel free to add, change, remove, or rearrange content as needed. This is a flexible toolbox then a time-consuming process.
 
# When to use this asset?
 
Use this template if you want to describe a solution for a customer.

# How to use this asset?
 
Write the document usually from top to bottom, removing guiding content and replacing examples with actual content. Decide if you need a chapter or not.

Chapters are described within the template.

You might want to use a Markdown editor, or possibly copy the structure into a Word document if you prefer.

You can find prewritten documents for various use cases in this repository, or create an Issue if you are missing something.
