## Document Purpose

*Guide:*

*Describe the purpose of this document and the Oracle-specific terminology*

*Example:*

This document provides a high-level solution definition for the Oracle solution and aims at describing the current state, and to-be state as well as a potential high-level project scope and timeline for ${doc.config.impl.type}.

The document may refer to a ‘Workload’, which summarizes the full technical solution for a customer (You) during a single engagement. The Workload is described in the chapter [Workload Requirements and Architecture](#workload-requirements-and-architecture).

This is a living document, additional sections will be added as the engagement progresses resulting in a final Document to be handed over to the ${doc.config.impl.type}.

# Business Context

*Guide:*

*Describe the customer's business and background. What is the context of the customer's industry and LoB? What are the business needs and goals that this solution is an enabler for? How does this technical solution impact and support the customer's business goals? Does this solution support a specific customer strategy, or maybe certain customer values? How does this solution help our customers to either generate more revenue or save costs?*

*Describe a clear statement of a business value as part of the full solution scope. Try to keep it SMART: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-Related - Agree on the business value with the customer. Keep it business-focused, and speak the language of the LoB: "Increase Customer Retention by 3% in the next year" or "Grow Customer Base with Executive Decision-Making from our Sales and Support Data". Avoid technical success criteria such as "Migrate App X to Oracle Cloud" or "Provision 5 Compute Instances". Avoid Oracle success criteria and language "Get Solution Consuming on OCI".*

*Furthermore, highlight Oracle differentiator and key values of the solution of our solution for the customer, allowing the customer to make decisions quickly.*

# Solution Requirements and Architecture

## Overview

*Guide:*

*Describe the Solution: What applications and environments are part of this migration or new implementation project, and what are their names? A possible implementation will be scoped later and can be a subset of the Solution Definition and proposed overall solution. For example, a solution could exist of two applications, but the implementer would only include one environment of one application. The solution chapter is about the whole solution and the implementation scope will be described later in the chapter [Solution Scope](#solution-scope).*

*You can describe an existing solution in the optional chapter for a Current State Architecture , which is typically located after the Non functional requirements and before the Future State Architecture.*

## Functional Requirements (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Provide a brief overview of the functional requirements, the functional area they belong to, the impacted business processes, etc.*

*Provide a formal description of the requirements as 1. a set of Use Cases or 2. a description of Functional Capabilities or 3. a Requirement Matrix. The three descriptions are not mutually exclusive.*

*Some Workload teams, especially the Analytics and Merging Tech teams, will create new applications based on functional requirements, some Workload teams will not touch the functional requirements at all and just change the platform under an application. However, it is important to understand who is using the system and for what reason.*

### Use Cases (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A Use Case (UC) can be represented in a table as the following one. See https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/use-case/what-is-use-case-specification/ for a quick introduction to the concept of UC. See https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/use-cases.html for more examples and detailed instructions.*

| Use Case Overview  | It is Wednesday and there is laundry in the laundry room. The housekeeper sorts it, then proceeds to launder each load. The housekeeper folds the dry laundry as he/she removes it from the dryer. The housekeeper irons those items that need ironing.                                                                                                          |
| Precondition 1     | It is Wednesday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Precondition 2     | There is laundry in the laundry room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Trigger            | Dirty laundry is transported to the laundry room on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Basic Flow         | On Wednesdays, the housekeeper reports to the laundry room. The housekeeper sorts the laundry that is there. Then he/she washes each load. The housekeeper dries each load. He/She folds the items that need folding. He/She irons and hangs the wrinkled items. The housekeeper throws away any laundry item that is irrevocably shrunken, soiled, or scorched. |
| Alternative Flow 1 | If he/she notices that something is wrinkled, he/she irons it and then hangs it on a hanger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Alternative Flow 2 | If he/she notices that something is still dirty, he/she rewashes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Alternative Flow 3 | If he/she notices that something shrank, he/she throws it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Functional Capabilities (Optional)

*Guide:*

*In specific cases, a set of Functional Capabilities can be represented in a functional decomposition diagram. This is typical of functional analysis in the System Engineering domain. For more information on Functional Analysis see, e.g. https://spacese.spacegrant.org/functional-analysis/.*

### Requirement Matrix (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A Requirement Matrix can be used when the solution will be based on software capabilities already available in existing components (either custom or vendor-provided). The Requirements Matrix is a matrix that is used to capture client requirements for software selection and to evaluate the initial functional “fit” of a vendor’s software solution to the business needs of the client.*

*Example:*

For example, rows can list required functional capabilities and columns can list available software components. Cells can contain a simple Y/N or provide more detail. The Requirements Matrix also is used to identify initial functional gaps or special software enhancements needed to enable each vendor’s software to fulfill the client’s desired system capabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*Guide:*

*Describe the high-level technical requirements for the solution. Consider all sub-chapters, but decide and choose which Non-Functional Requirements are necessary for your engagement. You might not need to capture all requirements for all sub-chapters.*

*This chapter is for describing customer-specific requirements (needs), not to explain Oracle solutions or capabilities.*

### Regulations and Compliances Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures specific regulatory or compliance requirements for the solution. These may limit the types of technologies that can be used and may drive some architectural decisions.*

*The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compliance Documents service lets you view and download compliance documents: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ComplianceDocuments/Concepts/compliancedocsoverview.htm*

*If there are none, then please state it. Leave the second sentence as a default in the document.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Regulatory and Compliance requirements have been specified.

In addition to these requirements, the latest version of the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundation Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/Oracle_Cloud) will be applied to the Customer tenancy.

### Environments

*Guide:*

*A diagram or list detailing all the required environments (e.g. development, text, live, production, etc.).*

*If you like to describe a current state, you can use or add the chapter 'Current Sate Architecture' before the 'Future State Architecture'.*

Example:

| Name       | Size of Prod | Location | DR  | Scope                              |
|:-----------|:-------------|:---------|:----|:-----------------------------------|
| Production | 100%         | Malaga   | Yes | Not in Scope / On-prem             |
| DR         | 50%          | Sevilla  | No  | Solution                           |
| Dev & Test | 25%          | Sevilla  | No  | Solution - ${doc.config.impl.type} |

### Reliability and Resilience

*Guide:*

*This section captures the resilience and recovery requirements for the solution. Note that these may be different from the current system.*

*The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirement of each environment should be captured in the environments section above, and wherever possible.*

-   *What are the RTO and RPO requirements of the Application?*
-   *What are the SLAs of the application?*
-   *What are the backup requirements*

*Note that if needed, this section may also include an overview of the proposed backup and disaster recovery proposed architectures.*

### Security Requirements

*Guide:*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for security-related topics. The requirements can be (but don't have to be) separated into:*

-   *Identity and Access Management*
-   *Data Security*

*Other security topics, such as network security, application security, key management, or others can be added if needed.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Security requirements have been specified.

#### Identity and Access Management (Optional)

*Guide:*

*The requirements for identity and access control. This section describes any requirements for authentication, identity management, single-sign-on, and necessary integrations to retained customer systems (e.g. corporate directories).*

-   *Is there any Single Sign On or Active Directory Integration Requirement?*
-   *Is the OS hardened if so please share the hardening guideline.*

#### Data Security (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Capture any specific or special requirements for data security. This section should also describe any additional constraints such as a requirement for data to be held in a specific location or for data export restrictions.*

### Networking Requirements

*Guide*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for networking-related topics. You can use the networking questions in the [Annex](#networking-requirement-considerations)*

*As businesses increasingly rely on Cloud Infrastructure to store, process, and transmit sensitive data, the need for comprehensive security solutions has never been more important. Potential customers evaluating network security solutions typically prioritize the following requirements: Some of the broader category considerations are below.*

-   *Data Protection: Safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access, theft, or modification is a primary concern for any organization and industry today.*
    -   *Threat Prevention: Advanced capabilities like IDPS and malware detection for blocking threats.*
    -   *Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Monitoring and controlling sensitive data transmission.*
    -   *Encryption and Decryption: Inspecting encrypted traffic without compromising privacy.*
-   *Threat Prevention: Proactively identifying and mitigating security threats is essential for maintaining the integrity of network infrastructure. *
    -   *Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Monitoring for suspicious or malicious activity.*
    -   *Application Control: Granular control over specific applications or services.*
    -   *URL Filtering: Controlling access to permitted URLs.*
-   *Security compliance: Does your organization have network security requirements based on industry or organization compliance? For example - SAMA (Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority), HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), SWIFT, etc.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Networking requirements have been specified.

### Integration and Interfaces (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A list of all the interfaces into and out of the defined Workload. The list should detail the type of integration, the type of connectivity required (e.g. VPN, VPC, etc.) the volumes, and the frequency.*

-   *list of integrations*
-   *list of user interfaces*

*Example:*

| Name                       | Source       | Target      | Protocol | Function         |
|:---------------------------|:-------------|:------------|:---------|:-----------------|
| IOT                        | Field Sensor | MQTT Server | MQTT     | Data collection  |
| ELT                        | ODI          | EBS DB      | SQL Net  | Data extraction  |
| General Ledger Integration | EBS          | ERP Cloud   | Batch    | Batch extraction |
| Mobile API                 | Mobile User  | HR Cloud    | Rest API | Via API Cloud    |

### System Configuration Control Lifecycle (Optional)

*Guide:*

*This section should detail the requirements for the development and deployment lifecycle across the Workload. This details how code will be deployed and how consistency across the environments will be maintained over future software deployment. This may include a need for CI/CD.*

-   *Will a CI/CD tool need access to deploy to the target environment*
-   *Does the customer require software to be delivered to a repository*
-   *How will configuration and software be promoted through the environments*

### Operating Model (Optional)

*Guide:*

*This section captures requirements on how the system will be managed after implementation and migration. In the vast majority of cases, the solution will be handed back to the customer (or the customer's SI/partner), but in some cases, Oracle may also take on some sustaining responsibilities through ACS or OC.*

*Also, capture requirements for tools to monitor and manage the solution.*

### Management and Monitoring

*Guide:*

*This subsection helps you capture any requirements for customer management and monitoring needs - e.g. system monitoring, systems management, log analysis, etc.*

*When you move or start an OCI project, you have a choice to use the tools you are familiar with (should they support modern application architectures), replace them with OCI native Observability services, or use a combination to improve your visibility. When contemplating how to proceed, here are some general questions that will guide you:*

-   *Does the tool manage across hybrid and multi-cloud environments?*
-   *What is the cost of integrating the existing tool with OCI?*
-   *Is my current monitor tool enabling you to prevent issues versus reacting to them?*
-   *Does the tool tell you how much impact there has been on users or just that there was an impact like something is down or unavailable? *
-   *Does the tool provide the full vision of applications and their infrastructure or just a piece of them or specific technology?*

*Example:*

| Task                   | Target         | Location        | New | Notes |
|:-----------------------|:---------------|:----------------|:----|:------|
| Application Monitoring | All targets    | On-Prem and OCI | No  |       |
| Monitoring             | All targets    | OCI (Migration) | No  |       |
| Log Management         | All targets    | OCI (Migration) | No  |       |
| Insight                | All Oracle DBs | OCI (Migration) | No  |       |

### Performance (Optional)

*Guide:*

*The performance requirements cover all aspects related to the time required to perform a given operation. They can be measured in different ways, for example: (1) AvrgTime: average response time that can be accepted for a given online or real interaction (data retrieve, data insert, etc.) (2) MaxTime: maximum response time for the same operations defined for AvrgRtime The operations can be online (user interactions), offline (batch execution) or (near)realtime (messaging).*

*Example:*

| Type     | Operation              | KPI                  | Unit     | Value | Notes |
|:---------|:-----------------------|:---------------------|:---------|:------|:------|
| Online   | Retrieve customer data | MaxTime              | sec      | 3     |       |
| Online   | Retrieve customer data | AvrgTime             | sec      | 0.2   |       |
| Realtime |                        | Receive MQTT message | AvrgTime | msec  | 100   |

### Capacity (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Capacity is a measure of the total workload the system can bear without affecting performance. There are many KPIs to measure capacity, depending on the system's functionalities. Some of the most relevant KPIs are:*

-   *MaxVol: maximum volume of data that can be stored in the system (can be different for different types of data, e.g. relational and file): 800-900GB current database size (probably with a significant waste of space)*
-   *MaxFlow: maximum data flow (input/output) that can be managed by the system (can be two different numbers for each major system interface and/or operation): the current value has not been measured but is expected to be at most a few GB.*
-   *MaxUser: maximum number of concurrent users (can be differentiated by user profile): up to 10 (number of registered users).*

*Example:*

| System     | Capacity               | KPI      | Unit | Value | Notes |
|:-----------|:-----------------------|:---------|:-----|:------|:------|
| DB server  | DB size                | MaxVol   | GB   | 2000  |       |
| ETL Server | Data processed nightly | MaxFlow  | GB/h | 100   |       |
| OAC Server | Simultaneous users     | MaxUsers | \-   | 10    |       |

## Constraints and Risks (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Constraints are limitations that will impact the resulting project or Solution Architecture. It is a technology- or project-related condition or event that prevents the project from fully delivering the ideal solution to customers and end-users. Constraints can be identified on our customer, partner, or even Oracle's side.*

*A project risk is an uncertain event that may or may not occur during a project.*

*Describe constraints and risks affecting the Workload and possible Logical Solution Architecture. These can be technical, but might also be non-technical. Consider budgets, timing, preferred technologies, skills in the customer organization, location, etc.*

*Example:*

| Name               | Description                                                              | Type       | Impact             | Mitigation Approach                                   |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| OCI skills         | Limited OCI skills in customers organization                             | Risk       | No Operating Model | Involve Ops partner, for example, Oracle ACS          |
| Team Availability  | A certain person is only available on Friday CET time zone               | Constraint |                    | Arrange meetings to fit that person's availability    |
| Access Restriction | We are not allowed to access a certain tenancy without customer presence | Constraint |                    | Invite customer key person to implementation sessions |

## Current State Architecture (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Provide a high-level logical description of the Workload's current state. Stay in the Workload scope, and show potential integrations, but do not try to create a full customer landscape. Use architecture diagrams to visualize the current state. I recommend not putting lists of technical resources or dependencies here. Refer to the attachments instead.*

## Future State Architecture

*Guide:*

*The Future State Architecture can be described in various forms. In the easiest case, we describe a Logical Architecture, possibly with a System Context Diagram. A high-level physical architecture is mandatory as a description of your solution.*

*This should be the final architecture as part of the pre-sales solution, not an intermediate or draft version*

*Additional architectures, in the subsections, can be used to describe needs for specific solution.*

### Solution Best Practices

Oracle highly recommends following best practices to protect your solution on OCI:

**Mandatory security best practices:**

The safety of the ${doc.customer.name}'s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) environment and data is the ${doc.customer.name}’s priority.

The following table of OCI Security Best Practices lists the recommended topics to provide a secure foundation for every OCI implementation. It applies to new and existing tenancies and should be implemented before the Workload defined in this document will be implemented.

Workload-related security requirements and settings like tenancy structure, groups, and permissions are defined in the respective chapters.

Any deviations from these recommendations needed for the scope of this document will be documented in the chapters below. They must be approved by ${doc.customer.name}.

${doc.customer.name} is responsible for implementing, managing, and maintaining all listed topics.

**OCI Landing Zones:**

An OCI Landing Zone sets the foundations for a secure tenancy, providing design best practices and operational control over OCI resources. A Landing Zone also simplifies the onboarding of workloads and teams, with clear patterns for network isolation and segregation of duties in the organization, which sets the cloud operating model for day-to-day operations.

Oracle highly recommends the use of an OCI Landing Zone for any deployment. Use these [guidelines](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/commons/lz_solution_definition.md) to set up your OCI Landing Zone, including design considerations, approaches, and solutions to use.

Note that all workloads in a tenancy should sit on top of a Landing Zone, meaning that the workload architecture defined in the next section can be subject to adjustments (e.g., network structure) towards the landing zone model, along with other future workloads.

### Logical Architecture

*Guide:*

*Provide a high-level logical Oracle solution for the complete solution. Indicate Oracle products as abstract groups, and not as physical detailed instances. Create an architecture diagram following the latest notation and describe the solution.*

*To implement a solution the Physical Architecture is needed in the next chapter. The physical notation can show individual components with physical attributes such as IP addresses, hostnames, or sizes.*

*[The Oracle Cloud Notation, OCI Architecture Diagram Toolkits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)*

### Physical Architecture

*Guide:*

*The solution architecture is typically described in a physical form. This should include all solution components. You do not have to provide solution build or deployment details such as IP addresses.*

*Please describe the solution with an architecture image plus a written text. If you have certain specifics you like to explain, you can also use the Solution Consideration chapter to describe the details there.*

*[The Oracle Cloud Notation, OCI Architecture Diagram Toolkits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)*

[StarterPacks (use the search)](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/)

*Example:*

![Future State Deployment Diagram - EBS Multi-AD, DR Design Diagram](images/MultiADDR-DeploymentDiagram-V2.pdf)

### Solution Considerations

*Guide:*

*Describe certain aspects of your solution in detail. What are the security, resilience, networking, and operations decisions you have taken that are important for your customer?*

*Typical key considerations are:*

-   *High Availability and Disaster Recovery*
-   *Security*
-   *Networking*
-   *Manageability and Observability*

*Feel free to describe other aspects and important requirements for your customer, and how your solution addresses them in this chapter.*

**Security:**

*Generic security guidelines are in the [Annex](#security-guidelines)*

**Networking:**

*If your customers have any or one of the needs described in the guide of the [Network Requirements](#networking-requirements), then the OCI Network Firewall (OCI NFW) is the cloud native solution that provides all of it. It is based on the industry-leading Nextgen firewall solution by Palo Alto (VM-Series). Refer to the Annex for more best practices around deployment models.*

*Networking Example*

The OCI Network Firewall can be deployed as a Distributed Network Firewall Model or Transit Network Firewall Model, where the firewall is hosted in the Hub VCN. In general, the OCI Network Firewall can be used to protect North-South traffic (Internet traffic) and/or East-West traffic (internal traffic). As a best practice, we do recommend using one dedicated OCI Network Firewall instance per type of traffic (North-South and East-West) in separated VCNs. This way performance will be maximized as well as ensuring the network isolation between the types of traffic.

For more information please follow [this link.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-network-firewall/index.html#GUID-875E911C-8D7D-4205-952B-5E8FAAD6C6D3)

**Reliability and Resilience:**

*Some useful links for this topic:*

-   [*Resilience on OCI*](https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/era-resiliency.htm)
-   [*Solution Related Content*](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/)

## Sizing and Bill of Materials

*Guide:*

*Estimate and size the physically needed resources of the solution. The information can be collected and is based upon previously gathered capacities, business user numbers, integration points, or translated existing on-premises resources. The sizing is possibly done with or even without a Physical Architecture. It is okay to make assumptions and to clearly state them!*

*Clarify with sales your assumptions and your sizing. Get your sales to finalize the BoM with discounts or other sales calculations. Review the final BoM and ensure the sales are using the correct product SKUs / Part Number.*

*Even if the BoM and sizing were done with the help of Excel between the different teams, ensure that this chapter includes or links to the final BoM as well.*

*Example:*

Production environment:

| Part   | Description       | Part Qty | Instance Qty | Usage Qty | Environment |
|--------|-------------------|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
|        | Category A        |          |              |           |             |
| B12345 | Example Service A | 10       | 1            | 1         | Prod        |
|        | Category B        |          |              |           |             |
| B98765 | Example Service B | 500      | 1            | 1         | Dev&Test    |

# Project Implementation (Only for Oracle Implementations!)

## Solution Scope

### Disclaimer

*Guide:*

*A scope disclaimer should limit scope changes and create awareness that a change of scope needs to be agreed upon by both parties.*

*Example:*

As part of the Oracle ${doc.config.impl.type} Project, any scope needs to be agreed upon by both the customer and Oracle. A scope can change but must be confirmed again by both parties. Oracle can reject scope changes for any reason and may only design and implement a previously agreed scope. A change of scope can change any previously agreed milestone and needs to be technically feasible.

All items not explicitly stated to be within the scope of the ${doc.config.impl.type} project will be considered out of scope. Oracle recommends the use of professional services to implement extensions or customizations beyond the original scope, as well as to operate the solution, with an Oracle-certified partner.

### Overview

*Guide:*

*Describe the scope of the implementation as a sub-set of the solution scope. For example one environment from one application.*

*Example:*

-   Design and configure “least privilege” access controls and enable user access using OCI IAM compartments, groups, and policies.
-   Design and provide a secure, scalable OCI network architecture.

### Business Value

*Guide:*

*What's the value for the customer to do an Oracle implementation? For example, speed of deployment and the resulting impact on time to market, and free service. Do not describe Oracle's value or consumption.*

*Example:*

The Oracle ${doc.config.impl.type} service brings several benefits to this project. All the activities mentioned within the scope will ensure the deployment of workload as per Oracle's best practices. As a tried and tested methodology by many customers, Oracle ${doc.config.impl.type} brings the speed of deployment resulting in successful projects without any setbacks. Oracle ${doc.config.impl.type} services will bring value to the overall project provisioning OCI environments for the application workload.

Oracle Cloud ${doc.config.impl.type} services provide guidance from cloud engineers and project managers on planning, project management, architecting, deploying, and managing cloud migrations.

### Success Criteria

*Guide:*

\*Technical success criteria for the implementation. As always be S.M.A.R.T: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound. Example: 'Deployment of all OCI resources for the scoped environments in 3 months'.

The success criteria below are an example - Please replace them with your tailored success criteria.\*

*Example:*

The below-listed success criteria are for the ${doc.config.impl.type} implementation only. Partner activities and success criteria are not listed in this documentation.

-   Finish provisioning of all OCI resources
-   Establish all required network connectivity
-   Successfully pass all test cases
-   Finished handover with documentation
-   Complete the Implementation Security Checklist

*Guide:*

*Describe deliverables within the implementation scope. Including this documentation as Solution Definition and the later following Solution Design. This should be a generic reusable text, provided by the implementers.*

### Included Activities

*Guide:*

*Describe the implementation activities in detail. It does not need to include a list of cloud services or OCI capabilities, but rather includes activities such as 'Provisioning of Infrastructure Components'. Include scope boundaries in terms of the number of environments, resource count to be provisioned, data volume to be migrated, etc.*

*Example:* The implementation scope of work includes the following activities:

### Recommended Activities

*Guide:*

*All activities not stated in the [Included Activities](#included-activities) are out of scope, as described in the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer). We do not provide a list of excluded activities to not create expectations based on a grey area between included and excluded activities. Here we only recommend further activities that happen to not be included but are not a full list of excluded activities.*

*Example:*

All items not explicitly stated to be within the scope of the implementation project will be considered out of scope. Oracle recommends the use of professional services to implement extensions or customizations beyond the original scope, or to operate the solution with any of Oracle's certified partners. As a part of this engagement, the below activities are considered to be out of implementation scope.

-   Any activities at customer on-premises or existing data center e.g. patching & backups required for migration
-   Any integration with other products than in scope
-   Any backup and recovery strategy implementation including third-party backup tool implementation

*Guide:*

*Describe dependencies between implementation or service providers. These can be inbound or outbound dependencies.*

### Transition Plan

*Guide:*

*The Transition Plan describes the handover of the project, after the implementation. Please ensure the accepting transition party is filled out.*

#### Introduction

Following the deployment of the solution to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure by the ${doc.config.impl.type} team, it is important to ensure a smooth handover to a technical team, or a partner. ${doc.config.impl.type} values the continuation of the cloud journey and we focus our efforts to ensure you start with the best possible foundation, to set you up for success in OCI.

When ${doc.config.impl.type} completes the deliverables as described in the [Workplan](#workplan) section of this document, ${doc.config.impl.type} will hand over the controls of the new OCI environment.

${doc.customer.name}, or a partner of your choice, will assume the ownership of the OCI tenancy and responsibility for further development of the OCI environment. From that moment forward, having completed the [Solution Scope](#solution-scope), ${doc.config.impl.type} will disengage. For post-implementation support, Oracle provides you with three distinct resources:

1.  Oracle Account Cloud Engineer (ACE) – This is your first point of contact and will provide technical leadership and support for Oracle cloud technologies and your cloud transformation.
2.  Cloud Adoption Manager (CAM) - Introduces and plans operation monitoring and optimization advisory activities, and continues working with you on the next milestones. Please contact your ACE for further information.
3.  [My Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com/portal/)

#### Transition Acceptance

When ${doc.config.impl.type} completes the deliverables as specified in the [Workplan](#workplan) section of this document, a closure session will be scheduled within 1-2 weeks to recap the project and to hand it over to the accepting party. In the case of this project, the accepting party is ${doc.config.impl.handover}. ${doc.config.impl.handover} is now responsible for the OCI tenancy.

From this moment forward, the Oracle ${doc.config.impl.type} team will fully remove their access from your OCI tenancy and provide the access credentials to the accepting party. This marks the completion of the ${doc.config.impl.type} project. There is no sign-off signature required.

## Security Guidelines

### Oracle Security, Identity, and Compliance

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is designed to protect customer workloads with a security-first approach across compute, network, and storage – down to the hardware. It’s complemented by essential security services to provide the required levels of security for your most business-critical workloads.

-   [Security Strategy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security-strategy.htm) – To create a successful security strategy and architecture for your deployments on OCI, it's helpful to understand Oracle's security principles and the OCI security services landscape.
-   The [security pillar capabilities](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security.htm#capabilities) reflect fundamental security principles for architecture, deployment, and maintenance. The best practices in the security pillar, help your organization to define a secure cloud architecture, identify and implement the right security controls, and monitor and prevent issues such as configuration drift.

### References

-   The Best Practices Framework for OCI provides architectural guidance about how to build OCI services in a secure fashion, based on recommendations in the [Best practices framework for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-best-practices).
-   Learn more about [Oracle Cloud Security Practices](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/cloud/).
-   For detailed information about security responsibilities in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Security Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Security/Concepts/security_guide.htm).

### Compliance and Regulations

Cloud computing is fundamentally different from traditional on-premises computing. In the traditional model, organizations are typically in full control of their technology infrastructure located on-premises (e.g., physical control of the hardware, and full control over the technology stack in production). In the cloud, organizations leverage resources and practices that are under the control of the cloud service provider, while still retaining some control and responsibility over other components of their IT solution. As a result, managing security and privacy in the cloud is often a shared responsibility between the cloud customer and the cloud service provider. The distribution of responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the customer also varies based on the nature of the cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

    -   Does the customer need to protect incoming or egressing traffic to the internet?
    -   Does the customer need to protect internal traffic (including on-premises via IPSEC/FC)?
    -   Is the network performance critical?
    -   Does the customer have any requirement on network isolation (i.e., internet traffic never traverses or is mixed with internal traffic)?
-   Have you considered the importance of protecting your web applications from potential cyber threats using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

-   How do you plan to monitor your application's network performance in OCI?
