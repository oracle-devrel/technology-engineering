# OCI Operations Tools

This chapter illustrates the tools available to support OCI Operations.

| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [**Cloud Shell**](https://docs.oracle.com/es-ww/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm) | Cloud Shell is a free-to-use browser-based terminal accessible from the Oracle Cloud Console that provides access to a Linux shell with pre-authenticated OCI CLI  |
| **Continuous Delivery Operations** | For advanced operations using continuous delivery patterns, we proposed the following GitOps patterns: •  **Declarative Operations** : focus on operating  **tfvars**  files that will be used to create and update infrastructure in OCI using Terraform•  **Procedural Operations** : focus on operating  **playbooks**  that will be used to interact with specific resources and their lifecycle or configurations using Ansible |
| [**OCI REST APIs**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm) | OCI APIs are the common technical interface, used by all other components below, for OCI interactions. OCI APIs are REST APIs that use HTTPS requests and responses. All API requests support HTTPS and SSL protocol TLS 1.2. |
| [**DevOps Tools**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/devopstools_topic-DevOps_Tools_and_Plugins.htm) | OCI provides several DevOps tools and plug-ins for working with OCI services. These can simplify provisioning and managing infrastructure or enable automated testing and continuous delivery: Ansible Collection, OCI Modules for PowerShell, Compute Jenkins Plug-in, Chef Knife Plug-in, Grafana Plug-in, Terraform Kubernetes Installer, Kubernetes Volume Provisioner, Jenkins X Integration, Packer Integration|
| [**SDKs**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm) | SDKs provide the tools you need to develop an app, including code samples and documentation to create, test, and troubleshoot. SDKs Available: SDK for Java, Python, for TypeScript and JavaScript, .NET, Go, and Ruby 
|
[**OCI CLI**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm#Command_Line_Interface_CLI) | The OCI CLI provides the same core capabilities as the OCI Console and provides additional commands that can extend the Console's functionality. The CLI is convenient for developers, operations, or anyone who prefers the command line to a GUI.The OCI CLI is built on the OCI SDK for Python and runs on Mac, Windows, or Linux. |
| [**Terraform**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraformgettingstarted.htm) | The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provider allows you to use Terraform to interact with OCI resources. Wherever you use a Terraform distribution you can use the OCI Terraform provider, including Terraform Cloud and the OCI Resource Manager |
| **PL/SQL SDK** | The SDK for PL/SQL enables you to write PL/SQL code to manage OCI resources. 
| **OCI Console** | The web-based user interface you can use to access and manage OCI.  |
