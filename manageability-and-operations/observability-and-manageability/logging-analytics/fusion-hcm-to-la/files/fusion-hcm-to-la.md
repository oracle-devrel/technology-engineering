**Create proper IAM policies for Logging analytics to allow Management Agent to upload the collected logs:**

[Using Logging Analytics - Allow continuous log collection using Management Agents](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/logging-analytics/doc/allow-continuous-log-collection-using-management-agents.html#GUID-AA23C2F5-6046-443C-A01B-A507E3B5BFB2)

The missing policy was:
```
ALLOW DYNAMIC-GROUP Management-Agent-Dynamic-Group TO {LOG_ANALYTICS_LOG_GROUP_UPLOAD_LOGS} IN TENANCY
```

Without this policy, you will get error:
```
17:30:55,010 [SendQueue.2 (SenderManager_sender)-41]
INFO --- LogUploadInvocation
←rsp[2MQ0U4Xxxxxxxxxxxxxx1D6865BE/9C1D623xxxxxxxxF3111B8ADFAEE373E]←
POST https://loganalytics.eu-frankfurt-1.oci.oraclecloud.com/20200601/namespaces/yourtenancyname/actions/uploadAgentLogFile?logSet=&payloadType=ZIP: [404]
```

When you perform the prerequisites for deploying Management Agents, you will need proper IAM policies configured.

Make sure the dynamic group for Management Agents has the necessary permissions.

**Install Management agent on a VM (Oracle Linux in OCI).**

Upload the JRE and Oracle agent to OCI Object Storage and get the file using wget from the PAR link:

```bash
ssh -i ssh-key.key opc@YourIPAddress
wget https://objectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/p/Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/n/YourNameSpace/b/Observability/o/oracle.mgmt_agent.250414.2239.Linux-x86_64.rpm
wget https://objectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/p/XXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/n/YourNameSpace/b/Observability/o/jre-8u381-linux-x64.rpm
sudo rpm -ivh jre-8u381-linux-x64.rpm
source /etc/profile.d/java.sh
sudo rpm -ivh oracle.mgmt_agent.250414.2239.Linux-x86_64.rpm
sudo /opt/oracle/mgmt_agent/agent_inst/bin/setup.sh opts=/opt/oracle/mgmt_agent/agent.rsp
```

After the agent is installed, add the RestAPI connections to emd.properties:

```bash
cd /opt/oracle/mgmt_agent/agent_inst/config
vi emd.properties

#Add at the end of the file:
loganalytics.rest_api.enable_oci_api=true
loganalytics.rest_api.report_interval=600

#Restart the agent
systemctl restart mgmt_agent
```

**After the agent is installed we need to collect the details about Fusion environment:**

- Your Fusion Application Instance URL, e.g.: https://your-fusion-domain
- Based on this URL, the REST API to use is: https://your-fusion-domain/fscmRestApi/fndAuditRESTService/audittrail/getaudithistory
- Your login credential to the FA instance. In our case we are using basic authentication with username and password.
</td>
<td align="left">
Make sure you have the correct Fusion Application URL and proper credentials with appropriate permissions to access the REST APIs.

**Create the Fusion Apps credentials on the OS:**

```bash
sudo su -
vi /tmp/FA-CREDS.json
```

Add the credential here:
```json
{
"source":"lacollector.la_rest_api",
"name":"FA-CREDS",
"type":"HTTPSCreds",
"description":"These are HTTPS (BasicAuth) credentials.",
"properties":
[
{ "name":"HTTPSUserName", "value":"CLEAR[YourFusionUsername]" },
{ "name":"HTTPSPassword", "value":"CLEAR[YourFusionPassword]" },
{ "name":"ssl_trustStoreType", "value":"JKS" },
{ "name":"ssl_trustStoreLocation", "value":"/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts" },
{ "name":"ssl_trustStorePassword", "value":"YOUR_PASSWORD" }
]
}
```

Run Credential_mgmt.sh script to define the Fusion Apps Credentials:

```bash
cat /tmp/FA-CREDS.json | sh /opt/oracle/mgmt_agent/agent_inst/bin/credential_mgmt.sh -o upsertCredentials -s logan
systemctl restart mgmt_agent
```

If you are using Oracle Cloud Agent plugin:
```bash
cat /tmp/FA_CREDS.json | sh /var/lib/oracle-cloud-agent/plugins/oci-managementagent/polaris/agent_inst/bin/credential_mgmt.sh -o upsertCredentials -s logan
```

After running the command you will get a message like:
```
Effect Credential Source

I have used the name FA-CRED because it's already configured in Logging Analytics Source.

Make sure to use the exact credential name as expected by the Logging Analytics sources.

**Congratulations!** You have configured Logging Analytics to collect Oracle Fusion logs. In my next blog I will show how to create queries for different Fusion detection rules, and create Dashboards that fits your daily needs.
