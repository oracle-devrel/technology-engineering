# Oracle Observability and Manageability

The Observability and Manageability (O&M) platform is a set of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services that enable visibility and insight across cloud-native and traditional technology, whether deployed in multicloud or on-premises environments, with broad, standards-based ecosystem support. It’s designed to help enterprises better manage their increasingly diverse and distributed IT portfolios while reducing troubleshooting time, preventing outages, and enabling IT to manage applications from a business perspective.
