# Technology Engineering GitHub Repository

## Introduction

### Who are we?

We are a team of Oracle specialists focusing on cloud and software products. We answer questions, create demos and workshops, provide hands-on guides, develop code snippets and examples, and perform health checks on existing solutions. We help our customers find solutions to business challenges and migrate workloads to the Oracle Cloud.

### Why do we have a Git Repository?

We create various interesting assets in our line of work, which we believe should be open-source and accessible to everyone. We want to share our architecture patterns for solutions, technical step-by-step guides, and code examples. We simplify how we work internally in Oracle, while also sharing access to the same assets with our customers, implementation partners, and everyone interested. We want to be transparent on how we work and also grow the quality of our assets and best practices, with contributions coming from the community.

## Getting Started

This is not a single software product repository, but a collection of various assets (code or not) in one single 'larger' repository. Thus, you won't 'install' this repository; rather, search it to find various interesting assets.

We structure our assets by our internal product areas and reflect this in the folder structure of this repository. The repository will have at least four levels of folders, starting with the first representing a wider product area (like Infrastructure Cloud), followed by a specific product area (like Compute), followed by a product or cloud service (like Bare Metal Compute), and finally by an asset for that product (like How-to-Guides).

As there is a lot of individual content within this repository and under a wider folder hierarchy, discovering that content is not as easy. Here's how you can find content or navigate the folder structure:

- Manually search via navigation through the folder hierarchy
- Use the search feature of GitHub on the top right-hand side of the browser - it works better if you are logged into your GitHub account. You can search specific code languages and filter content that way. Also, you can search for keywords such as 'Workshop'. Lastly, if you enter the search from a subfolder, you can choose to only search in that folder, hopefully resulting in more useful search results.
- Use direct links to share a specific asset or folder of the repository.

Some of our assets are code-based and can also be installed. There is always a README file within the asset folder, explaining the installation process.

## Documentation

As per the previous chapter on how to install, we have various assets in this one larger repository. If you find a code asset, it will have a README file for installation, documentation, and example purposes.

## Examples

As per the previous chapter on *Getting Started*, we have various assets in this one larger repository. If you find a code asset, it will have a README file for installation, documentation, and example purposes.

See the bullet points from the chapter *Getting Started* list as an example on how to navigate the repository.

## Help

If you find an error, can't find what you were looking for, or would like to suggest a new asset, please use the Issues feature of GitHub (Account login required).
