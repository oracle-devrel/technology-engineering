# Image-to-Text with Oracle OCI Gen AI

This application is built using **Streamlit** and **Oracle OCI Generative AI**, allowing users to upload an image, input a prompt, and receive a text-based response generated by the AI model. It leverages Oracle's Gen AI Inference API for processing multimodal data (text and image).

## Features

- Upload an image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`).
- Provide a natural language prompt describing your query about the image.
- Get a detailed response generated by Oracle's Generative AI model.
- Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Oracle OCI Configuration**
   - Set up your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account.
   - Obtain the following:
     - **Compartment OCID**
     - **Generative AI Service Endpoint**
     - **Model ID** (e.g., `meta.llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct`).
       - **Update:** New multi-modal models have been added to OCI; feel free to change the model to `meta.llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8` as this is the latest model from Llama
   - Configure your `~/.oci/config` file with your profile details.

2. **Python Environment**
   - Install Python 3.8 or later.
   - Install required dependencies (see below).

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure OCI:
   Ensure your `~/.oci/config` file is set up with the correct credentials and profile.

4. Edit [`app.py`](./app.py) and insert a valid Compartment OCID.

---

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Upload an image and provide a prompt in the text input field. Click **Generate Response** to receive the AI-generated output.

## Dependencies

List of dependencies (found in `requirements.txt`):
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web UI.
- **oci**: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK.
- **base64**: For encoding images.

Install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure your OCI credentials and Compartment OCID are correct in the script.
- Check the image format and size for compatibility.
- Use the appropriate Generative AI service endpoint for your region.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: `oci.exceptions.ServiceError`**
  - Check if your compartment OCID and API keys are configured correctly.
  
- **Streamlit does not load:**
  - Verify that Streamlit is installed and the application is running on the correct port.
