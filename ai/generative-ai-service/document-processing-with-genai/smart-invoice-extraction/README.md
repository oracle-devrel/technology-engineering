## 🎯 When to Use This Asset (Who & When)

### Who
- **Finance & accounting teams** processing inbound invoices  
- **Insurance & operations teams** extracting policy-linked invoice data  
- **AP automation & digital transformation teams** reducing manual entry  

### When
- When invoices arrive as **unstructured PDF scans**  
- When required fields **vary by invoice type or vendor**  
- When high accuracy is needed from **visual + textual context**  
- When structured **JSON/CSV outputs** are needed for downstream systems  


## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Automatically identifies key invoice headers using OCI Vision LLM (LLaMA 3.2 90B Vision or Llama 4 Maverick)
- 🤖 Lets you choose what elements to extract (with type selection)
- 🧠 Leverages a text-based LLM (Cohere Command R+) for context-aware value extraction
- 🧪 Outputs data in clean **JSON** and saves to **CSV**
- 🖼️ Uses image-based prompt injection for high accuracy

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Uploads Invoice PDF**  
   The file is uploaded and converted into an image using `pdf2image` (Ensure you upload one page documents ONLY)

2. **Initial Header Detection (LLaMA-3.2 Vision or Llama 4 Maverick)**  
   The first page is passed to the multimodal LLM which returns a list of fields that are likely to be useful (e.g., "Policy No.", "Amount", "Underwriter").

3. **User Selects Fields and Types**  
   A UI allows the user to pick 3 fields from the detected list, and specify their data types (Text, Number, etc.).

4. **Prompt Generation (Cohere Command A)**  
   The second LLM generates a custom system prompt to extract those fields as JSON.

5. **Full Invoice Extraction (LLaMA-3.2 Vision or Llama 4 Maverick)**  
   Each page image is passed into the multimodal LLM using the custom prompt, returning JSON values for the requested fields.

6. **Data Saving & Display**  
   All data is shown in a `st.dataframe()` and saved to CSV.
