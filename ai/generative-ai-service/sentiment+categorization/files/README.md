# Customer-Agent Conversation Analysis and Categorization Demo
This demo showcases an AI-powered solution for analyzing batches of customer messages, categorizing them into hierarchical levels, extracting sentiment scores, and generating structured reports.

## Key Features
* **Hierarchical Categorization**: Automatically categorizes messages into three levels of hierarchy:
	+ Primary Category: High-level categorization
	+ Secondary Category: Mid-level categorization, building upon primary categories
	+ Tertiary Category: Low-level categorization, providing increased specificity and detail
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Extracts sentiment scores for each message, ranging from very negative (1) to very positive (10)
* **Structured Reporting**: Generates a comprehensive report analyzing the batch of messages, including:
	+ Category distribution across all three levels
	+ Sentiment score distribution
	+ Summaries of key findings and insights

## Data Requirements
* Customer messages should be stored in a CSV file(s) within a folder named `data`.
* Each CSV file should contain a column with the message text.

## Python Version
This project requires **Python 3.13** or later. You can check your current Python version by running:
```
python --version
```
or
```
python3 --version
```

## Getting Started
To run the demo, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. *(Optional but recommended)* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Place your CSV files containing customer messages in the `data` folder. Ensure each includes a column with the message text.
4. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.

## Example Use Cases
* Analyze customer feedback from surveys, reviews, or social media platforms to identify trends and patterns.
* Inform product development and customer support strategies by understanding customer sentiment and preferences.
* Optimize marketing campaigns by targeting specific customer segments based on their interests and concerns.

## Technical Details
* The solution leverages Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GenAI, a suite of AI services designed to simplify AI adoption.
* Specifically, this demo utilizes the Cohere R+ model, a state-of-the-art language model optimized for natural language processing tasks.
* All aspects of the demo, including:
	+ Hierarchical categorization
	+ Sentiment analysis
	+ Structured report generation are powered by GenAI, ensuring accurate and efficient analysis of customer messages.
