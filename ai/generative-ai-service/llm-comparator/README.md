# LLM Performance Comparator

A web application that enables side-by-side comparison of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their fine-tuned counterparts on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The application provides an intuitive interface to evaluate model performance, response quality, and inference time improvements achieved through fine-tuning.

# When to use this asset?

**Data Scientists, ML Engineers or Developers** would use this asset when evaluating the effectiveness of fine-tuned models against their base counterparts, demonstrating fine-tuning improvements to stakeholders, making data-driven decisions about model deployment and selection, benchmarking different fine-tuning configurations, and validating fine-tuning results before production deployment.

**AI/ML Team Leaders** would use this asset when presenting ROI of fine-tuning investments to management, comparing multiple fine-tuning approaches (LoRA or T-Few) and establishing best practices for model evaluation workflows.

# How to use this asset?

Configure your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure credentials and endpoints in the config file, install the required dependencies and run the application. Select your base model and fine-tuned variant from the dropdown menus, enter your test prompt, and generate side-by-side comparisons. The application displays response quality, inference times, and detailed fine-tuning parameters to help you make informed decisions about model deployment.
