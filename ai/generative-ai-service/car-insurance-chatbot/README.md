# 🚗 Insurance Image/Video Analyzer — OCI GenAI

A Streamlit-based multimodal application that analyzes **vehicle images or videos** for insurance claim triage using **Oracle Generative AI**.

This tool allows insurance professionals and adjusters to upload accident images or a short video clip, and receive a concise, expert-style report summarizing vehicle condition, visible damages, and safety concerns — all generated through a single multimodal LLM call.

### Insurance-Focused Vehicle Damage Report
- Custom prompt tuned for **insurance adjuster** workflows.
- Structured output covering:
  - Vehicle details (make, model, color, visible plates)
  - Damage assessment by section (front, rear, sides, roof, wheels)
  - Safety & driveability insights
  - ADAS & sensor recalibration notes
  - Prior damage indicators
  - Concise summary for claims review

### Multimodal LLM (Llama 4 Maverick)
- Performs reasoning across **all frames and views** to remove duplicates and highlight consistent damage regions.
- Handles both still images and continuous video input.
- Supports temperature control and token limit configuration.

## 📝 How to Use

   → Images (`.jpg`, `.png`) or one video (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`)  
   → PDFs are also supported (converted to images internally)

2. **Set parameters**  
   - Choose frame extraction interval (default = 12)  
   - Limit total frames (default = 120)  
   - Adjust temperature (default = 0 for deterministic outputs)

3. **Ask your question**  
   Example queries:
   - “Describe the visible vehicle damages.”
   - “Summarize the safety concerns.”
   - “What parts likely need recalibration?”

4. **View results**  
   → The app displays:
   - Frame thumbnails  
   - A single final LLM report combining all inputs  
   - Structured markdown-formatted sections

## 🛠️ Customization

- Modify `INSURANCE_PROMPT` to tailor report tone or add fields (e.g., **cost estimate**, **liability hints**, **repair recommendations**).
- Adjust `MAX_VIDEO_FRAMES` and `MAX_TOKENS` for performance vs detail.
- Add export features (CSV, PDF) via Streamlit’s `st.download_button`.
