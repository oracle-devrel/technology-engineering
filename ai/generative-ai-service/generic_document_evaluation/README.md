# When to use this asset?
 
Analysts, compliance teams, auditors, or operational staff would use this asset whenever they need to systematically evaluate, validate, or categorize documents‚Äîsuch as visa applications, insurance claims, or student financial aid requests‚Äîbased on well-defined criteria.

Developers and solution architects may also use this asset to rapidly prototype or demo document analysis workflows, including LLM-driven or human-in-the-loop review scenarios.
 
# How to use this asset?
 
Collect the Documents: Gather one or more PDFs containing the applications or claims to be evaluated.

Define Evaluation Criteria: Prepare a CSV file listing the evaluation criteria and descriptions tailored for the specific use case (e.g., insurance claim completeness, income eligibility for student aid). Optionally, you can give the criteria in a free-format in the front-end including additional requirements that may not be criteria.

Run the Tool: Upload the documents and relevant criterion.

Automated Evaluation: The tool analyzes the content of each document, evaluating and categorizing them according to your criteria.

Review the Results: Receive a professional, human-readable markdown report showing the outcome for each document (Ready to Admit, Conditional, Rejected), along with explanations and a summary table.

Take Action: Use the evaluation output to make operational decisions (e.g., approve/reject applications, flag items for manual review, generate audit trails).
