# AI Services
 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI Services, Generative AI Services and Generative AI Agents are a collection of services with prebuilt machine learning and Generative AI models that make it easy for developers to apply AI to applications and business processes. The models can be custom-trained (or fine-tuned) for more accurate business results. Teams within an organization can reuse the models, datasets, and data labels across services. OCI AI makes it possible for developers to easily add AI to applications without slowing down application development.
