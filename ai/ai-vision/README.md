# AI Vision
 
OCI Vision is an AI service for performing deep-learningâ€“based image analysis at scale. With prebuilt models available out of the box, developers can easily build image recognition and text recognition into their applications without machine learning (ML) expertise. For industry-specific use cases, developers can automatically train custom vision models with their own data. These models can be used to detect visual anomalies in manufacturing, organize digital media assets, and tag items in images to count products or shipments.

# Reusable Assets Overview

## Cloud Coaching

- [Cloud Coaching - Boost Your Oracle AI Services](https://youtu.be/VVWTqqlIEhg)
    - Describe an image using OCI AI Vision, Generative AI Service and Oracle Integration 
- [Cloud Coaching - Unlock Culinary Creativity: AI Powered Cooking Adventure from Fridge to Fork!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRVwTLKS4rE&t)
    - You are in the mood of cooking an exotic dish. You open the refrigerator, and using the mobile phone, access your favourite retail app to scan the items you have and submit. 
      -  This triggers a series of actions:
      -  OCI AI Vision identifies the items (specific vegetables, egg, chicken etc).
      -  On choosing your favourite cuisine, OCI Generative AI suggests a list of dishes based on identified items.
      -  On selecting your favourite dish, OCI Generative AI provides the detailed recipe. Also, the missing ingredients are listed, with an option to order the same. 
- [Cloud Coaching - Discover OCI Vision for Object Detection in Manufacturing, Retail, & More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHH_1MXGOc0)
    - In this session you learn how OCI Vision can identify, classify, and quantify visual data in powerful ways. Watch as the service identifies objects (people, cars, trees, and so forth) and categorizes them. See how it can even detect faces or key points in faces for analysis.
