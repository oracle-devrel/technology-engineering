## Setup Instructions

### OCI Generative AI Model (Cohere or LLaMA on OCI)

1. Go to: OCI Console → Generative AI  
2. Select a model like:  
   `meta.llama-3.3-70b-instruct`  
3. Copy the following values:
   - model_id  
   - compartment_id  
   - endpoint (e.g., `https://inference.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com`)  
4. Paste them in `config.py`  

Documentation:  
[OCI Generative AI Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm)

No API key is required — authentication is handled via OCI identity.

Ensure your OCI CLI credentials are configured.  
Edit or create the following config file at `~/.oci/config`:

```
[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..exampleuniqueID
fingerprint=c6:4f:66:e7:xx:xx:xx:xx
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..exampleuniqueID
region=eu-frankfurt-1
key_file=~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem
```

### Start the Chatbot

Streamlit UI:
```bash
streamlit run assistant_ui_langgraph.py
```

You will see a full chat interface with support for uploading CSVs and PDFs, asking questions, and receiving answers backed by the AI Agent (`csv_analyzer_agent.py`).

| Tool                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CSV Upload               | Load a CSV file and analyze it with questions                              |
| PDF Extraction           | Extracts structured fields like title, items, department, justification     |
| Request Routing          | Determines if user input relates to CSV or PDF                              |
| Secure Code Generation   | Uses OCI GenAI to generate Python code to analyze your data                 |
| Security Check           | Prevents execution of harmful code (e.g., delete, drop)                     |
| Code Execution           | Executes LLM-generated Python code safely in a sandboxed context            |
| Answer Generation        | Summarizes execution results into a final natural language response         |
| State Management         | Remembers chat history, extracted information, and uploaded files           |
| Sidebar Display          | Shows PDF structured data and generated code for full transparency          |

## Notes

- Supports both document inputs (CSV + PDF)  
- Uses LangGraph to orchestrate tool routing and execution  
- Modular design — individual tools can be expanded or replaced  
- Streamlit UI provides a fully interactive interface with visual progress and outputs  
- Built to run on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with native LLM integration  

## Prompt Customization

All core prompts used by the agent are stored in `prompts.py`.

You can easily modify or extend these prompts to change how the agent performs routing, extraction, analysis, and natural language response generation.

The prompt for extraction can be found in `csv_analyzer_agent.py`.
