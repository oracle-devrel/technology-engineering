# AI Speech

OCI Speech offers speech-to-text (STT) capabilities for files and real-time streams, as well as text-to-speech (TTS) functionality - All in one solution.

It’s accessible via Console, REST, CLI, and SDKs. Outputs are written to your Object Storage bucket as JSON (with word-level timestamps & confidences) and optionally SRT for captions.

Recent updates include Live Transcribe for real-time ASR and Whisper model support for multilingual transcription alongside Oracle’s native ASR models.
