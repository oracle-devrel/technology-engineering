# Generative AI services and Cohere
 
Oracle’s AI strategy is to make artificial intelligence (AI) pervasive across its cloud
applications and cloud infrastructure. We serve business users who want to
improve business processes and outcomes through prebuilt AI capabilities, data
scientists and developers who want complete control to build and deploy AI
models of any kind, and independent software vendors (ISVs) who want the
most performant and cost-effective platform to host their AI services.
