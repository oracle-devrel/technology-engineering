# Managed Attachment Solution 

Content Server documents are listed as managed attachments to business application entities in a customizable window launched from a link, button, or menu, depending on business application configuration. For example, a business application user displays an Employee record, invokes the Managed Attachment functionality by clicking a button, and attaches a passport image and supporting identity documents.

The Managed Attachments Solution, shown in Figure 1-10, enables business users to attach, scan, and retrieve attachments stored in a Content Server repository. An Oracle WebCenter Content Server repository enables users throughout an enterprise to view, collaborate on, and retire content, ensuring that content is secure, accurate, and up-to-date.
