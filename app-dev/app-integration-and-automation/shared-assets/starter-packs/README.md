# WAD Starter Packs

Workload Architecture Document (WAD) is a standardized document Oracle Technology Engineering team is using to describe cloud solutions and architectures. Typically it contains logical (solution) architecture, deployment architecture on OCI, functional and non-functional requirements.

The document is written in markdown and we use draw.io for architecture pictures and diagrams. The sub folders contain so called starter packs, which represent WAD templates for specific areas (simple application integration, application integration with SaaS, etc.)
