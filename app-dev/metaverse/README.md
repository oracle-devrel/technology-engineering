# Implement a metaverse instance on OCI
 
The metaverse—a virtual world where people live, learn, play, work, shop, and interact with others—is where virtual and digital worlds merge.

The metaverse stack needs to support social interaction, 3D / 2D representation, artificial intelligence (AI), cross-platform functionality, and offer transparency. Metaverse market size was valued at USD 22.79 billion in 2021 and is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate near 40% between 2022–2030.
