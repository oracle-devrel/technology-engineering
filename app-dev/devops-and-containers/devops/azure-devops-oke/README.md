## Building and Deploying to OKE with Azure DevOps

There are two ways (at least) to build and deploy to OKE from Azure DevOps:
<ul>
    <li>Use OCI VM as Azure parallel job self-hosted build agent that will run as <code>instance-principal</code> and hence no OCI credentials are needed to be shared with Azure DevOps. Here <code>kubectl</code> and OCI native tooling like <code>oci cli</code> can be used in pipelines.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Use Azure DevOps native <code>tasks</code> that can run as either Azure-hosted or as self-hosted Azure parallel jobs. Credentials will be stored to Azure DevOps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For this example I've used the second option. I'm also using a self-hosted agent/runner on OCI but that's just because I can use the <code>always-free</code> VM instance for it as part of the default OCI subscription and I don't have any Azure-hosted agents available in my Azure subscription. Technically that does not matter since the agent is a vanilla Oracle Linux VM instance and does not contain any customizations whatsover to do the pipeline work (it could however, but it does not).

## Copy the files to the Azure DevOps repo

To make this build and deploy to OKE to work is not a big task. First copy the files in this repo to you empty Azure DevOps project repo.

## Create OCIR repository for the test image

Before building the Docker image repo needs to be created under the desired <code>compartment</code>. This can be easily done using OCI Cloud UI. Name the repository as <b><i>Azure-test</i></b>, for example.

<p>
Then modify the <code>deployment.yaml</code> <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/app-dev/devops-and-containers/devops/azure-devops-oke/deployment.yaml#L19">line 19</a> by replacing the &lt;TENANCY_NAMESPACE&gt; with yours and if you gave another name for the OCIR repo then modify also that here, too. Modify also the <code>region</code> if using some other OCI region than <b><i>fra.ocir.io</i></b>.

<p>
To be able to do <code>Docker login</code> to the repo create <code>auth token</code> for your OCI user unless you already have one.
    
## Create OKE cluster (or use existing) and setup Service Account for Azure DevOps

Using Cloud UI and OKE Quick create setup a new Kubernetes cluster in OCI for this example. Alternatively you can also use an existing one. Make sure the OKE cluster has <code>public</code> API endpoint access for <code>kubectl</code>.

<p>
Once the OKE cluster is up and running with <code>kubectl</code> access setup the Service Account for Azure DevOps by following this guide: 
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengaddingserviceaccttoken.htm" target="_NEW">https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengaddingserviceaccttoken.htm</a>. 
    
<p>
Name the secret <b><i>oke-kubeconfig-azure-token</i></b> as in <code>azure-token.yaml</code> <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/app-dev/devops-and-containers/devops/azure-devops-oke/azure-token.yaml#L4" target="_NEW">line 4</a>.

## Setup Azure DevOps OCI connections for OKE and OCIR

To make the Azure DevOps pipeline to work with OCIR and OKE two <code>Service Connections are</code> needed with the following settings:
<ul>
    <li>OCIR</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Type: Docker Registry</li>
        <li>Registry Type: Others</li>
        <li>Docker ID: Your OCI user e.g. <i>&lt;TENANCY_NAMESPACE&gt;/oracleidentitycloudservice/mika.rinne@oracle.com</i></li>
        <li>Docker Password: Your OCI user's auth token</li>
        <li>Service connection name: OCIR</li>
        <li>Grant access permissions to all pipelines: YES</li>
    </ul>
    <li>OKE</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Type: Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Authentication method: Service Account</li>
        <li>Server URL: OKE cluster server address from your <i>~/.kube/config</i> e.g. <i>https://145.144.233.100:6443</i></li>
        <li>Authorization Secret: Get the secret JSON by doing <i>kubectl get secret oke-kubeconfig-azure-token -n kube-system -o json</i> and paste it here</li>
        <li>Service connection name: OKE</li>
        <li>Grant access permission to all pipelines: YES</li>
    </ul>
</ul>


## Create env vars for the build pipeline

Create a pipeline from existing Azure DevOps pipeline file by selecting the project repo and the file <b><i>azure-pipelines.yaml</i></b>.

Edit the created pipeline and select <code>Variables</code> to create them as follows:

<ul>
    <li>CONTAINER_REGISTRY: OCIR</li>
    <li>CONTAINER_REPOSITORY: Use the same name as in the <code>deployment.yaml</code> <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/app-dev/devops-and-containers/devops/azure-devops-oke/deployment.yaml#L19">line 19</a> but <b><i>without</i></b> the <code>region</code> and the <code>tag</code> ("1" in the example YAML file) e.g. <b><i>&lt;TENANCY_NAMESPACE&gt;/azure-test</i></b></li>
    <li>containerImageFullNameForK8sDeploy: The same as above but with the OCI region e.g. <b><i>fra.ocir.io/&lt;TENANCY_NAMESPACE&gt;/azure-test</i></b></li>
    <li>K8S_CONNECTION_NAME: OKE</li>
    <li>K8S_NAMESPACE: default</li>
    <li>OcirPullSecret: ocirsecret</li>
</ul>

## Run the pipeline

Pipeline runs automatically after commiting changes and when all of the above are properly set it should complete succesfully.

<p>
<img src="azure-devops-oke.png" width="800" />

<p>
Pipeline will create a Kubernetes <b><i>load balancer</i></b> service to provide a public access point to the pod in the OKE cluster:

<p>
<PRE>
kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)             AGE
httpd-lb     LoadBalancer   10.96.175.74   144.200.51.195   80:32452/TCP        4h1m
</PRE>

<p>
Calling the LB endpoint with cURL or from the browser should show an echo:

<p>
<PRE>
curl 144.200.51.195
{
  "path": "/",
  "headers": {
    "host": "144.200.51.195",
    "user-agent": "curl/8.4.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "method": "GET",
  "body": "",
  "fresh": false,
  "hostname": "144.200.51.195",
  "ip": "::ffff:10.0.10.220",
  "ips": [],
  "protocol": "http",
  "query": {},
  "subdomains": [],
  "xhr": false,
  "os": {
    "hostname": "httpd-59d9987665-ltn8s"
  },
  "connection": {}
}%
</PRE>
