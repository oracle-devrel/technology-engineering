# Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)
 
Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) is a popular and powerful managed Kubernetes running on OCI. It boosts Kubernetes with powerful networking based on OCI VCN, resilient block and file storage, and tight security integration with OCI IAM. It's well known for its [capabilities](https://developer.oracle.com/learn/k8s/k8s_comparison.html) offering great price-performance ratio. It's the heart of every cloud-native architecture in OCI.
