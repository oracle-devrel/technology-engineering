# A Java Hello World function with local dev and then building and deploying to OCI Functions

This is an example how I'm locally developing and testing OCI Functions on my mac with Apple silicon that uses mainly ARM architecture and then building and deploying the same to Functions in OCI.

### Local Dev

I've installed maven and <code>Fn cli</code> on my mac. This is how to do the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsinstallfncli.htm">Fn cli install</a> or like in here <a href="https://fnproject.io/tutorials/install/">following the Fn tutorial</a>. 

<p>

To develop functions locally I'm running the Fn server; to do this I'm using this command with Rancher Desktop instead of doing the usual <code>fn start</code> that works for me:

<pre>
docker run --rm -i --name fnserver \
-v /tmp/iofs:/iofs \
-e FN_IOFS_DOCKER_PATH=/tmp/iofs \
-e FN_IOFS_PATH=/iofs \
-v /tmp/data:/app/data \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--privileged \
-p 8080:8080 \
--entrypoint ./fnserver \
-e FN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG fnproject/fnserver:latest
</pre>

<p>
Now that the Fn server is running create an application for our function using the cli:

<pre>
fn create app hellofunction
</pre>

<p>

Then clone this repo and project and cd to the project root directory. Then run Fn cli command to build and deploy the function locally:

<pre>
fn --verbose deploy --app hellofunction --local
</pre>

<p>

After this you are ready to call the function to test it:

<pre>
fn invoke hellofunction hellofunc
Hello, world!
</pre>

or

<pre>
echo 'Mika' | fn invoke hellofunction hellofunc
Hello, Mika!
</pre>

### OCI

Now that the function is properly working locally let's build and deploy it to OCI.

<p>

First create a OCIR repo for the container in your OCI tenancy <code>compartment</code> you want push the container into. Unless you do this first the container will be pushed to the <code>root</code> comaprtment that is not a good idea and will usually lead to 404 or 502 errors when the OCI Function pulling the container due to missing OCI policies. You can create the OCIR repo from the Cloud UI or using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/3.41.0/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/artifacts/container/repository/create.html">oci cli</a>.

<p>

Next, let's build the Docker container for the function using <code>docker build</code>, let's not use Fn this time (that is also possible), using the FRA region:

<pre>
docker build -t fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworld-java:1 .
</pre>

In the docker build command above replace the <code>region</code> if necessary and the <code>&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;</code> with yours.

<p>

After building let's do <code>docker login</code> and <code>docker push</code> to push the container to the OCIR repo:

<p>

<pre>
docker login ams.ocir.io -u '&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/oracleidentitycloudservice/&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;' -p '&lt;YOUR ACCESS TOKEN&gt;'
docker push fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworld-java:1
</pre>

<p>

The last step is to create the Function Application and the function deployment for it. This can be easily done using the Cloud UI. 

<p>

To create a mac binary compatible Function Application use the <code>shape GENERIC_ARM</code>. Let's name this <code>hello-arm</code>.

<p>

Using the application create a function for it from the container image that was pushed to the OCIR repo e.g. <code>fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworld-java:1</code>. Let's name this <code>helloworld-java-arm</code>.

<p>

After deployment the Function can be easily tested in Cloud Shell following the Getting Started guide for the Application and giving:

<pre>
echo 'Mika' | fn invoke hello-arm helloworld-java-arm
Hello, Mika!
</pre>

<p>

Optionally can create API Gateway for the function that will assign a public endpoint to it over HTTPS that can be easily tested with curl:

<pre>
curl -d "Mika" https://n3yu.....ghhi.apigateway.eu-frankfurt-1.oci.customer-oci.com/
Hello, Mika!
</pre>
