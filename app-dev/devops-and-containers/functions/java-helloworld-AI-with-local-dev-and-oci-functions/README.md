# A Java AI featured function with local dev and then building and deploying to OCI Functions

This is an example how I'm locally developing and testing OCI Functions on my mac with Apple silicon that uses mainly ARM architecture and then building and deploying the same to Functions in OCI.

<p>

This example is based on the <a href="../java-helloworld-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions">java-helloworld-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions</a> and hence building and deploying is exactly the same but this time uses <code>OCI SDK</code> and <code>OCI Generative AI services</code> to produce the function output instead of just a simple "Hello World".

<p>

To do the OCI SDK authentication and authorization to use the GenAI services the function uses two options:
<ul>
<li>IAM regular <b>user auth</b> for the local dev and test on mac</li>
<li><b>InstancePrincipal</b> auth for the OCI Function by passing config key <code>AUTH_INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL</code> with any value (then not being null)</li>
</ul>

<p>
IAM user option will work on both cases above, as local and as OCI Function.

Testing with curl (or copy-pasting the API Gateway deployment url to a browser):
