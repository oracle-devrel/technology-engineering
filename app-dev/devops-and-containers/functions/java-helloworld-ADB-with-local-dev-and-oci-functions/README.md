# A Java Hello World function accessing ATP database with local dev and then building and deploying to OCI Functions

Reviewed: 14.04.2025
 
# When to use this asset?
 
Anyone who wants to develop Functions with Autonomous Database access and this example shows how I'm doing this locally using Fn (<a href="https://fnproject.io">https://fnproject.io</a>) on my mac with Apple silicon that uses mainly ARM architecture and then building and then deploying the same to Functions in OCI.

# How to use this asset?

## Local Dev

I've installed maven and <code>Fn cli</code> on my mac. This is how to do the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsinstallfncli.htm">Fn cli install</a> or like in here <a href="https://fnproject.io/tutorials/install/">following the Fn tutorial</a>. 

<p>

To develop functions locally I'm running the Fn server. Normally you would start it with <code>fn start</code> command but I'm using this command with Rancher Desktop that works for me:

<pre>
docker run --rm -i --name fnserver \
-v /tmp/iofs:/iofs \
-e FN_IOFS_DOCKER_PATH=/tmp/iofs \
-e FN_IOFS_PATH=/iofs \
-v /tmp/data:/app/data \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--privileged \
-p 8080:8080 \
--entrypoint ./fnserver \
-e FN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG fnproject/fnserver:latest
</pre>

<p>
Now that the Fn server is running create an application for our function using the cli:

<pre>
fn create app hellofunction
</pre>

<p>

Then clone this repo and project and cd to the project root directory under <code>/files</code>. Then run Fn cli command to build and deploy the function locally:

<pre>
fn --verbose deploy --app hellofunction --local
</pre>

## Testing 

Create new ATP database instance (eg. "fntest") with a public VCN/subnet and <i>Access type</i> <code>Allow secure access from specified IPs and VCNs</code> and set the <i>Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication</i> to <code>Not required</code>. 

<p>

To access the ATP database from local dev your <i>IP address</i> needs to be <b>whitelisted</b> in the ATP instance Network configuration.

<p>
Before running the function config for the ATP connection needs to be set:

<pre>
fn config app hellofunction DB_USER admin
fn config app hellofunction DB_PASSWORD &lt;YOUR ATP PASSWORD HERE&gt;
fn config app hellofunction DB_URL (description= (retry_count=20)(retry_delay=3)(address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1521)(host=adb.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com))(connect_data=(service_name=g90....6d8_fntest_tp.adb.oraclecloud.com))(security=(ssl_server_dn_match=yes)))
</pre>

<code>DB_URL</code> can be found by clicking the <i>Database Connection</i> -button on ATP database instance in the Cloud UI, e.g. :

<img src="./files/ATP_connection_url.png" with="1200" />

<p>

After this you are ready to call the function to test it and get the SYSDATE from ATP:

<pre>
fn invoke hellofunction hellofunc
2025-04-14 08:49:13
</pre>

## OCI

Now that the function is properly working locally let's build and deploy it to OCI.

<p>

First create a OCIR repo for the container in your OCI tenancy <code>compartment</code> you want push the container into. Unless you do this first the container will be pushed to the <code>root</code> comaprtment that is not a good idea and will usually lead to 404 or 502 errors when the OCI Function pulling the container due to missing OCI policies. You can create the OCIR repo from the Cloud UI or using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/3.41.0/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/artifacts/container/repository/create.html">oci cli</a>.

<p>

Next, let's build the Docker container for the function using <code>docker build</code>, let's not use Fn this time (that is also possible), using the FRA region:

<pre>
docker build -t fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworld-java:1 .
</pre>

In the docker build command above replace the <code>region</code> if necessary and the <code>&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;</code> with yours.
<p>

After building let's do <code>docker login</code> and <code>docker push</code> to push the container to the OCIR repo:

<p>

<pre>
docker login ams.ocir.io -u '&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/oracleidentitycloudservice/&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;' -p '&lt;YOUR ACCESS TOKEN&gt;'
docker push fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworld-java:1
</pre>

<p>
The same as above but using OCI cli to get the &lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt; which is especially handy in scripting:

<pre>
export namespace=$(oci os ns get | jq .data | tr -d '"')
docker build -t fra.ocir.io/$namespace/helloworld-java:1 .
docker push fra.ocir.io/$namespace/helloworld-java:1
</pre>

<p>
The last step is to create the Function Application and the function deployment for it. This can be easily done using the Cloud UI. 

<p>

To create a mac binary compatible Function Application use the <code>shape GENERIC_ARM</code>. Let's name this <code>hello-arm</code>.

<p>

Using the application create a function for it from the container image that was pushed to the OCIR repo e.g. <code>fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR OCI TENANCY NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworld-java:1</code>. Let's name this <code>helloworld-java-arm</code>.

<p>

Like previously add the configuration for the ATP database connection, either on the application or function level (both will work with our example function) using the Cloud UI:

<pre>
DB_USER admin
DB_PASSWORD &lt;YOUR ATP PASSWORD HERE&gt;
DB_URL (description= (retry_count=20)(retry_delay=3)(address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1521)(host=adb.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com))(connect_data=(service_name=g90....6d8_fntest_tp.adb.oraclecloud.com))(security=(ssl_server_dn_match=yes)))
</pre>

<p>
To access the ATP database from the OCI Function the <i>function application VCN</i> needs to be <b>whitelisted</b> in the ATP instance Network configuration either by using it's <code>OCID</code> or <code>CIDR block</code>.
<p>

After deployment the Function can be easily tested in Cloud Shell following the Getting Started guide for the Application and giving:

<pre>
fn invoke hello-arm helloworld-java-arm
2025-04-14 08:49:13
</pre>

<p>

Optionally can create API Gateway for the function that will assign a public endpoint to it over HTTPS that can be easily tested with curl:

<pre>
curl https://n3yu.....ghhi.apigateway.eu-frankfurt-1.oci.customer-oci.com/
2025-04-14 08:49:13
</pre>
