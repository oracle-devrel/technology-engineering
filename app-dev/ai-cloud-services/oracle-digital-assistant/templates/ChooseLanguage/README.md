This sample ODA skill shows setting the language by initailly having the user select his prefered language from a menu.

Take a look at the 'z.Welcome' intent to see how language is asked and set.

In the web-sdk of the ConciergeTemplate there are also options available to automatically set the language based on the users browser locale setting. See 'web.txt' in the ConciergeTemplate.
