## 1. What are Workload Landing Zones 

A workload landing zone is an **OCI solution design ready to receieve specific workloads**. Each of these landing zones follow the follows the [tailored landing zone approach](/landing-zones/tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md) and have a design and a runtime, ready for deployment:

- In terms of **design**, each solution will contain the security, network, and runtime views. 

- In terms of **running**, each solution will have a runtime view with **IaC configurations**, ready to be deplyed. Please note that the workload elements (VMs, Databases, etc.) are not deployed.
