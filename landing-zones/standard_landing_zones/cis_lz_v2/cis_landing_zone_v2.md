# CIS LZ v2

<img src="../../images/landing_zone_300.png">

## 1. Before You Start
Before starting and creating the configuration, we recommend:
1. Understand [CIS Landing Zone v2 Architecture](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/cis-oci-benchmark/index.html) and the OCI elements involved, as you'll be configuring the solution.
2. Review the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart) as it contains the complete solution documentation.
3. Execute the Live Labs ["Deploy a Secure Landing Zone in OCI"](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3662).

## 2. Create The Setup Configuration

Your deliverable will be an OCI Landing Zone configuration. This configuration will contain all the input parameter values, that any implementation team can follow and execute. This activity is important as it will create the master configuration to enable repeatable deployments.

There are two deployment models described below.

| DEPLOYMENT MODEL  | WHEN TO USE | GUIDELINES  |  EXAMPLES | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) | Use this option by default |[View](/standard_landing_zones/cis_lz_v2/orm/orm_configuration_guide.pdf)  | [Quick Start](/standard_landing_zones/cis_lz_v2/orm/samples/oci_cislz_configuration_example-quickstart_scenario.pdf)<br> [Production](/standard_landing_zones/cis_lz_v2/orm/samples/oci_cislz_configuration_example-production_scenario.pdf) |
| Terraform Command Line | Use this option if you have advanced terraform skills or require code extensions |*Soon* | |

A configuration for the ORM deployment can have the format of a document, with parameters/values per ORM step, while the Terraform Command Line can have the format of tfvars.

## 3. Deploy the Configuration

 This activity will execute the deployment configuration in a tenancy. The team responsible for this activity might not be the same in the previous step, and the configuration created will contain all the necessary information for the landing zone deployment. 

The guidelines below can be used and shared informally with the deployment team to guide the process.

| DEPLOYMENT MODEL  | WHEN TO USE | GUIDELINES  |  
|---|---|---|
| Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) | Use this option by default | [Review Steps](/standard_landing_zones/cis_lz_v2/orm/orm_deployment_guide.pdf)<br>[Review Live Lab](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3662) | 
| Terraform Command Line | Use this option if you have advanced terraform skills or require code extensions | *Soon*
