# Landing Zones

With Landing Zones, we simplify the OCI onboarding experience and reduce OCI day-one and day-two efforts. We provide Landing Zone assets, best practices, and approaches covering the complete spectrum of OCI landing zones, from the standards ones with the CIS LZ and OELZ to the most strategically tailored design with IaC.
