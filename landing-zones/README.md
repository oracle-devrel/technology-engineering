# LANDING ZONE FRAMEWORK

&nbsp; 

Welcome to the **Landing Zone Framework (LZF)**. 

The LZF is a set of assets that aim to **simplify the OCI onboarding experience** and **reduce OCI day-one and day-two efforts**. It provide **best practices**, and approaches covering the complete spectrum of OCI landing zones, from the **Standards** ones with the CIS LZ and OELZ to the **Tailored** approaches with IaC configurations.  


&nbsp; 


| APPROACH  |  DESCRIPTION | ASSET  |  
|---|---|:---:|
| <a href="standard_landing_zones/standard_landing_zones.md" ><img src="images/slz.png" alt= “” width="600" height=""></a>  | A standard landing zone is a **prescribed** approach to landing zones with a **guided setup** by the user, using an existing IaC solution. This is the recommended approach for initial landing zone deployments covering the most-common workload scenarios.  | **[VIEW](/standard_landing_zones/standard_landing_zones.md)** | 
| <a href="tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md" ><img src="images/tlz.png" alt= “” width="600" height=""> </a>  | A tailored landing zone is a solution to **fit specific requirements** when the standard approach is not enough. It's an **IaC configuration-driven** approach, simple to set up, and is normally used to bridge with existing operating models, with fine-grained segregations of duties, strong network isolation, heterogeneous workloads, among others.  |  **[VIEW](/tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md)** |   |
