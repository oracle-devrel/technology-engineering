# USER IDENTITY MANAGEMENT

## 1. Introduction

Like in every environment, OCI has users who work with the platform or the services provisioned on it. For life cycle management these are often managed by dedicated user identity management platforms already in place at the customer's enterprise environment.

Depending on the role, each user (or persona) plays, different processes are used to maintain their status and permissions.

This pattern explains the personas and related processes.

Before you start, take these considerations into account:
- Never share accounts between users.
- Never share passwords between users.
- Never create shared accounts for tenancy global administration.
- Never trust your password.

## 2. User Personas

### 2.1 OCI Platform Administrator

OCI Platform Administrator Personas use the Default domain only. **No other user persona should be in this domain.** [See Design Guidance for IAM Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/iam-security-structure.htm#IAM-identity-domains)
&nbsp; 
| TYPE  |  DESCRIPTION | USER TYPE | RESPONSIBILITIES | CAPABILITIES | LIFE CYCLE | OCI GROUP MEMBERSHIP | FEDERATED | DOMAIN | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Emergency User | A dedicated group of users that are able to maintain the tenancy when nothing else works. | Human users only | - Not for daily business. <br> - Bootstrapping of Emergency Users, Federation, and Provisioning of Groups and Users. Initial Group and Policy Setup. <br>- Resolve operational issues which cannot be handled by other personas. <br>- Allowed user capabilities (sage of any user capability (apart from the local password) is prohibited! | Local password | Manual, documented process (see implementation example) | Administrators | No | Default
Administrators |  Dedicated groups of users to manage the OCI platform resources on a daily business. Groups for specific resource types should be used to implement proper segregation of duties. | Human users | - For daily business. <br> - Resource-specific groups to maintain OCI resources. | API Keys, Auth Keys, SMTP Credentials, Customer Secret Keys, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials | Through user provisioning where the customer identity management system is the source of truth. | | Yes | Default |
| CI/CD process | Dedicated group for automation of OCI resource management. | Non-human user | For daily business. Several CI/CD users are for distinct tasks, i.e., one for the common tenancy configuration, and one per OE, are possible. | API Keys | Through user provisioning where the customer identity management system is the source of truth. | DevOps group(s) | Yes | Default | 
| Auditors | A single dedicated group with read-only access to all OCI resources. | Human users<br> Non-human user | For daily business. | API Keys | Through user provisioning where the customer identity management system is the source of truth. | Auditors group | Yes | Default |

### 2.2 Workload User

Workload User Personas are workload dependent and may life in the related resources (like OS users or Database schema users). Workload personas should **never** be part of the *Default* domain. [See Design Guidance for IAM Identity Domains](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/iam-security-structure.htm#IAM-identity-domains)

| TYPE  |  DESCRIPTION | USER TYPE   | LIFE CYCLE | OCI GROUP MEMBERSHIP | FEDERATED | DOMAIN | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OS User | A user working in the VM as an OS user. Permissions are granted at the OS level. <br> *Not related to any OCI groups and policies.* | Root users <br>Human users  | If possible, through user provisioning where customer identity management system is the source of truth. | N/A | Optional | Not required<br> Dedicated domain| 
| Database User | A user working in a database using a database schema user. Permissions are granted within the database. <br>*Not related to any OCI groups and policies.* | DBAs, Admin users<br>Schema users  | If possible, through user provisioning where customer identity management system is the source of truth. | N/A | Optional | Not required<br> Dedicated domain| 
| Application User | A user working in an application. <br>*Not related to any OCI groups and policies.*  | Application Administrators<br>Application Users<br>Backplane processes  | If possible, through user provisioning where the customer identity management system is the source of truth. | N/A | Optional | Not required<br> Dedicated domain| 
| PaaS User | A user working in PaaS services. <br>*Not related to any OCI groups and policies.*  | PaaS-related user types | If possible, through user provisioning where the customer identity management system is the source of truth. | N/A | Optional | Dedicated domain | 

&nbsp; 

## 3. Identity Federation

Identity Federation will be handled by the respective Identity Domain. Implementation steps depend on the product used by the customer and are listed in the OCI platform user guide:

- [SSO Between OCI Microsoft Azure](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/tutorials/azure_ad/sso_azure/azure_sso.htm)
- [SSO With OCI and Okta](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/tutorials/okta/sso_okta/sso_okta.htm)
- [Federating with Identity Providers](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/federating/federating_section.htm)

&nbsp; 
## 4. Identity Provisioning

Identity Provisioning is the sibling part of the Identity Federation setup. Identity Federation requires user identities that are provisioned by Identity Provisioning. This includes the whole life cycle of the process (joiners/movers/leavers). When a user access has been revoked (leavers/movers) the related user capabilities will be removed automatically.

Implementation Steps depend on the product used by the customer. It is highly recommended to use SCIM-based automation.

The OCI platform user guide provides detailed steps for these products:

- [Identity Lifecycle Management Between OCI IAM and Azure AD](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/tutorials/azure_ad/lifecycle_azure/azure_lifecycle.htm)
- [Identity Lifecycle Management Between OCI and Okta](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/tutorials/okta/lifecycle_okta/okta-lifecycle.htm)

&nbsp; 

## 5. Emergency or Break Glass Process

Emergency or Break Glass users are not intended for daily business but for rare emergency use cases when nothing else works anymore, i.e., no federation, no connectivity to third-party environments, etc. They are tenancy local users authenticated with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and adaptive security control.
