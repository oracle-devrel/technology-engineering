# RESOURCE NAMING CONVENTIONS

## 1. Introduction

A resource naming convention helps to identify resources, their type, and location by the name, quickly. If you don't have any naming convention in place, we recommend the following Resource Naming Convention:

- Segments of the name are separated by "-".
- Within a name segment avoid using &lt;space&gt; and ".".
- Where possible intuitive/standard abbreviations should be considered (e.g., use "shared" instead of "shared.cloud.team").
- When referring to the compartment fully qualified compartment path, use ":" as a separator, e.g. cmp-shared:cmp-security

Examples of names are:
- cmp-shared
- cmp-&lt;workload&gt;
- cmp-networking

The patterns used for the names are:
- &lt;resource-type&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;-&lt;location&gt;-&lt;purpose&gt;
  &lt;resource-type&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;-&lt;source-location&gt;-&lt;destination-location&gt;-&lt;purpose&gt;
- &lt;resource-type&gt;-&lt;entity/sub-entity&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;-&lt;function/department&gt;-&lt;project&gt;-&lt;custom&gt;
