# Custom Applications and Consolidation 

This Architecture Group is focused on helping customers migrate on-premises applications written in Java with WebLogic middleware (WLS) to Oracle Cloud or applications using non-Weblogic application servers like Wildfly, Apache, etc. Besides Lift and Shift of Custom Applications, we can add more value to your choice with a migration & modernization pathway to Cloud Native & Oracle Cloud. You can mix traditional Java and Cloud Native architectures on Oracle OCI with supported deployments of Weblogic on VMs and/or OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine). 

# Database Consolidation 

Database consolidation means running databases on a common set of infrastructure, most often to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency. The business drivers and approaches to consolidation are the same, regardless of whether consolidation is done in an on-premises data center, or in the Cloud. This Architecture Group focuses on giving the reader a better understanding of the business drivers behind consolidation as well as the tools available to strike the best balance between consolidation and isolation to meet business goals
