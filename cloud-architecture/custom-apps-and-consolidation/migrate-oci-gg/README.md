    - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate is a fully managed, native cloud service that moves data in real-time, at scale. To reduce business costs and maintenance, OCI GoldenGate is an ideal option for database real-time migration and Disaster Recovery (DR) setup. Enterprise data is typically distributed across the enterprise in heterogeneous databases. To get data between different data sources, we can use OCI GoldenGate to load, distribute, and filter transactions within your enterprise in real-time, and enable migrations between different databases in near-zero downtime. 
    - This is a step-by-step guide demonstrating a simple migration from GoldenGate Marketplace to OCI GoldenGate. No administrative tasks are required for the databases involved with the replication and no downtime is required for the source business application.
