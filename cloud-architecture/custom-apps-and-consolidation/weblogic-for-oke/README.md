# WebLogic For OKE

The content in this folder is about the [WebLogic for Oracle Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-container/index.html) deployment.


## Assets made available include the following

- Architecture examples 
- Reusable assets, such as questionnaires, sizing tools, diagrams examples
- Best practices and guidelines
- Technical Briefs 

## How to use these assets?

This content has been shared to facilitate the adoption of Oracle technology and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Cloud Platform.
The examples collected here are to be considered as a starting point to develop and build a custom-specific architecture that will cover the requirements
peculiar to the workload. As for the various topics addressed we don't expect to cover all aspects but want to present some interesting points of view or specific 
deployment examples. The reusable assets are updatable artifacts (drawio diagrams, questionnaires, sizing tools, scripts, etc..)
meant to be used, again, as _templates_ so we expect that readers will use them to build a customized solution that meets the specific requirements
of their projects.

## Content List  

Following is the content currently available:

1. _weblogic_for_oke_acme_architecture.pdf_: a simple example of a WebLogic workload architecture built in OCI and leveraging the OKE deployment of WebLogic. Included, as reusable asset, there are the Drawio 
diagrams of the architecture.
