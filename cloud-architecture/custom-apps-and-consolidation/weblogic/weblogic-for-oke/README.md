# When to use this asset?

Use these resources if you want to document and describe a containerized WebLogic deployment in OKE.

# How to use these assets?

This content has been shared to facilitate the adoption of Oracle technology and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Cloud Platform.
The examples collected here are to be considered as a starting point to develop and build a custom-specific architecture that will cover the requirements
peculiar to the workload. As for the various topics addressed we don't expect to cover all aspects but want to present some interesting points of view or specific 
deployment examples. The reusable assets are updatable artifacts (drawio diagrams, questionnaires, sizing tools, scripts, etc..)
meant to be used, again, as _templates_ so we expect that readers will use them to build a customized solution that meets the specific requirements
of their projects.

## WebLogic Workload - Example Of Architecture Leveraging OKE  

A simple example of a WebLogic workload architecture built in OCI and leveraging the OKE deployment of WebLogic. It includes

- a technical brief: _weblogic_for_oke_acme_architecture.pdf_
- a reusable Drawio file with the diagrams used in the previous file: _weblogic_for_oke_acme_architecture.drawio_
