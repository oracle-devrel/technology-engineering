# 3rd Party and ISV Applications

3rd Party Applications are those applications that are not in-house developed by your customer. They bought it from a 3rd Party Application vendor. 3rd Party Applications support business processes and/or more technical processes. Examples are SAP, Tableau, ForgeRock, Microsoft Dynamics etc. From a technology point of view, 3rd Party Applications are built and deployed on a wide variety of technologies, e.g. Operating Systems like Microsoft Server and various Linux flavors, sometimes they run on-prem on systems like AIX. Also, the application platforms vary a lot. We have seen Java/Tomcat/JBoss/Weblogic and others, as well as PHP, .net and other languages. Also in the area of Databases, we encountered a wide variety of technologies ranging from Oracle to Microsoft SQL, MongoDB, Postgres, Redis (although more a cache), MySQL and many more.

ISV Applications are very similar to the above description of 3rd Party Applications, but the company developing the application is using Oracle technology. Examples are Dassault Enovia, Temenos and Murex.
