*Guide:*

*Describe the purpose of this document and the Oracle-specific terminology, specifically around 'Workload'.*

*Example:*

This document provides a high-level solution definition for the Oracle solution and aims at describing the current state, and to-be state as well as a potential project scope and timeline. The intended purpose is to provide all parties involved with a clear and well-defined insight into the scope of work and intention of the project.

The document may refer to a 'Workload', which summarizes the full technical solution for a customer (You) during a single engagement. The Workload is described in the chapter [Workload Requirements and Architecture](#workload-requirements-and-architecture).

# Business Context

*Guide:*

*Describe the customer's business and background. What is the context of the customer's industry and line of business? What are the business needs and goals which this Workload is an enabler for? How does this technical solution impact and support the customer's business goals? Does this solution support a specific customer strategy, or maybe certain customer values? How does this solution help our customers to either generate more revenue or save costs?*

## Executive Summary

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Oracle differentiator and key values of the solution for the customer, allowing the customer to make decisions quickly.*

Example:

The scope of this project is to deliver a working **Test environment including one deployment of Essbase 21c marketplace** in OCI.

Customer's on-premises Essbase deployments can be migrated to run on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure without requiring significant configuration, integration, or process changes. The resulting implementation will be more flexible and more reliable than on-premises or other cloud deployments. Oracle has a validated solution to accomplish these goals, quickly and reliably. This solution includes procedures, supporting Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform services, and reference architectures. These consider real production needs, like security, network configuration, disaster recovery (DR), identity integration, and cost management.

By moving Essbase systems to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure the following benefits could be realized:

1. The lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than on-premises deployments
2. Managing and reducing CAPEX, and ensuring that the data centers you maintain are efficient while eliminating server hardware, and taking advantage of cloud flexibility where possible
3. Rapid in-place technology refresh
4. Proactive monitoring of usage and costs
5. Scaling up or down to handle business growth or workload bursts

## Workload Business Value

*Guide:*

*A clear statement of specific business value as part of the full workload scope. Try to keep it SMART: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-Related - Agree on the business value with the customer. Keep it business-focused, and speak the language of the LoB which benefits from this Workload: "Increase Customer Retention by 3% in the next year" or "Grow Customer Base with Executive Decision-Making from our Sales and Support Data". Avoid technical success criteria such as "Migrate App X to Oracle Cloud" or "Provision 5 Compute Instances". Avoid Oracle success criteria and language "Get Workload Consuming on OCI".*

Example:

The customer has been using Essbase for more than X years and is one of the key strategic applications that is used to analyze data and support enterprise-wide planning, budgeting, and forecasting. The customer intends to improve the overall performance and availability of the Essbase applications to enable faster modelling and decision-making. With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, customer benefits by eliminating hardware management and flexible scaling options for increased usage during consolidation processes.

# Workload Requirements and Architecture

## Overview

*Guide:*

*Describe the Workload: What applications and environments are part of this Workload migration or new implementation project, and what are their names? The implementation will be scoped later and can be a subset of the Solution Definition and proposed overall solution. For example, a Workload could exist of two applications, but the implementer would only include one environment of one application.*

Example:

The current project includes provisioning of the Oracle Cloud infrastructure and deploying Essbase 21c via Marketplace.
This project also involves the migration of two Essbase applications from version 11.1.2.4 currently hosted on-premises and used by the customer.

The customer has 2 Essbase environments currently:

| Environment     | Description |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| PROD   | 1 single server deployed on Windows 2012 R2 STD with MS SQL Server  |
| DEV    | 1 single server deployed on Windows 2012 R2 STD with MS SQL Server   |

## Functional Requirements (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Provide a brief overview of the functional requirements, the functional area they belong to, the impacted business processes, etc.*

*Provide a formal description of the requirements as 1. a set of Use Cases or 2. a description of Functional Capabilities or 3. a Requirement Matrix. The three descriptions are not mutually exclusive.*

*Some Workload teams, especially the Analytics and Merging Tech teams, will create new applications based on functional requirements, some Workload teams will not touch the functional requirements at all and just change the platform under an application. However, it is important to understand who is using the system and for what reason.*

### Use Cases (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A Use Case (UC) can be represented in a table as the following one. See https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/use-case/what-is-use-case-specification/ for a quick introduction to the concept of UC. See https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/use-cases.html for more examples and detailed instructions.*

*Example:*

Element                         | Description
:---                            |:---
Use Case 1                      | Housekeeper does laundry
Stakeholder                     | Owner
Actor                           | Housekeeper
Use Case Overview               | It is Wednesday and there is laundry in the laundry room. The housekeeper sorts it, then proceeds to launder each load. The housekeeper folds the dry laundry as he/she removes it from the dryer. The housekeeper irons those items that need ironing.
Precondition 1                  | It is Wednesday
Precondition 2                  | There is laundry in the laundry room.
Trigger                         | Dirty laundry is transported to the laundry room on Wednesday.
Basic Flow                      | On Wednesdays, the housekeeper reports to the laundry room. The housekeeper sorts the laundry that is there. Then he/she washes each load. The housekeeper dries each load. He/She folds the items that need folding. He/She irons and hangs the wrinkled items.  The housekeeper throws away any laundry item that is irrevocably shrunken, soiled, or scorched.
Alternative Flow 1              | If he/she notices that something is wrinkled, he/she irons it and then hangs it on a hanger.
Alternative Flow 2              | If he/she notices that something is still dirty, he/she rewashes it.
Alternative Flow 3              | If he/she notices that something shrank, he/she throws it out.

### Functional Capabilities (Optional)

*Guide:*

*In specific cases, a set of Functional Capabilities can be represented in a functional decomposition diagram. This is typical of functional analysis in the System Engineering domain. For more information on Functional Analysis see, e.g. https://spacese.spacegrant.org/functional-analysis/.*

### Requirement Matrix (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A Requirement Matrix can be used when the solution will be based on software capabilities already available in existing components (either custom or vendor-provided). The Requirements Matrix is a matrix that is used to capture client requirements for software selection and to evaluate the initial functional “fit” of a vendor’s software solution to the business needs
of the client.*

*Example:*

For example, rows can list required functional capabilities and columns can list available software components. Cells can contain a simple Y/N or provide more detail. The Requirements Matrix also is used to identify initial functional gaps or special software enhancements needed to enable each vendor’s software to fulfill the client’s desired system capabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*Guide:*

*Describe the high-level technical requirements for the Workload. Consider all sub-chapters, but decide and choose which Non-Functional Requirements are necessary for your engagement. You might not need to capture all requirements for all sub-chapters.*

*This chapter is for describing customer-specific requirements (needs), not to explain Oracle solutions or capabilities.*

### Regulations and Compliances Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures specific regulatory or compliance requirements for the Workload. These may limit the types of technologies that can be used and may drive some architectural decisions.*

*The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compliance Documents service lets you view and download compliance documents:
https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ComplianceDocuments/Concepts/compliancedocsoverview.htm*

*If there are none, then please state it. Leave the second sentence as a default in the document.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Regulatory and Compliance requirements have been specified.

In addition to these requirements, the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundation Benchmark, v1.2](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/Oracle_Cloud) will be applied to the Customer tenancy.

### Environments

*Guide:*

*A diagram or list detailing all the required environments (e.g. development, text, live, production, etc.).*

*If you like to describe a current state, you can use or add the chapter 'Current State Architecture' before the 'Future State Architecture'.*

Example:

Name	        | Size of Prod  | Location	  | DR    | Scope
:---		    |:---		   	|:---		  |:---   |:---
Production      | 100%        	| Frankfurt	  | Yes   | Not in Scope / On-prem
UAT              | 50%           | Madrid     | No    | Workload
Dev      | 25%           | Madrid     | No    | Workload - ${doc.config.impl.type}


### High Availability and Disaster Recovery Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures the resilience and recovery requirements for the Workload. Note that these may be different from the current system.*

*The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirement of each environment should be captured in the environments section above, and wherever possible.*

- *What are the RTO and RPO requirements of the Application?*
- *What are the SLAs of the application?*
- *What are the backup requirements*

*Note that if needed, this section may also include an overview of the proposed backup and disaster recovery proposed architectures.*

*This chapter is mandatory, while there could be no requirements on HA/DR, please mention that in a short single sentence.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Resilience or Recovery requirements have been specified.

#### High Availability (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A subsection, if cleaner separation of Resilience and Recovery into HA, DR, and Backup & Restore is needed.*

*Example:*

The following table captures the High availability requirements for the Production environment:

Service Name  	| KPI	            	| Unit	  	| Value
---		      		|---	            	|---	    	|---
Oracle DB		       		| Uptime	          | percent		| 99.98
Essbase Application	| Max Interruption	| minutes 	| 20

#### Disaster Recovery (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A subsubsection, if cleaner separation of Resilience and Recovery into HA, DR, and Backup & Restore is needed.*

*Example:*

Environment  |RPO   |RTO
--|---|--
PROD  | 24 Hours  |  4 Hours
UAT  | 24 Hours  |  4 Hours

#### Backup and Restore (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A subsection, if cleaner separation of Resilience and Recovery into HA, DR, and Backup & Restore is needed.*

*Example:*

Service Name	    | KPI		    | Unit		| Value
:---			   	|:---		    |:---		|:---
Database			    	| Frequency	  	| /day		| 2
Block Storage			    	| BckpTime (F)	| hours		| 4

Current Backup Schedule:

Currently, Essbase is backed up with some backup scripts once every day. MSSQL uses full backups once every week, incremental backups once every day and log backups once every hour.

OCI Backup Requirements:

Essbase backup and restore planning is required at both the application and instance level to have full flexibility to manage the life cycle of the Essbase instances, and also to provide disaster recovery.

Backups of individual applications protect you from application failures or application artifact corruption, and can easily be migrated between servers. When you restore a single application, there is no disruption to user activity with other applications in your instance. Essbase application backups are taken using LCM export and import commands.

Use Essbase instance backups to restore all applications on your instance to a common point in time. Instance backups are primarily for disaster recovery, but are also appropriate when you want to migrate or restore all applications at once. Backups of Essbase on OCI depend on some details of the Essbase stack. A complete backup must protect all information that makes your Essbase deployment unique. Items you may be instructed to back up include:

* Relational database schemas which store some application, user and configuration information.
* Essbase application and database information stored on a block volume mounted as /u01/data.
* WebLogic domain and configuration information stored** on a block volume mounted as /u01/confg.

For OCI, the Backup tier will be set to Gold: The gold policy includes daily incremental backups, retained for seven days, along with weekly incremental backups, run on Sunday and retained for four weeks. Includes monthly incremental backups, run on the first day of the month, retained for twelve months. Also, include a full backup, run yearly, during the first part of January. This backup is retained for five years. The backups can be potentially done to a different cloud region as well. Refer to the documentation for more details: [Scheduling volume backups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Tasks/schedulingvolumebackups.htm)

### Security Requirements

*Guide:*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for security-related topics. Security is a mandatory subsection that is to be reviewed by the x-workload security team. The requirements can be separated into:*
- *Identity and Access Management*
- *Data Security*

*Other security topics, such as network security, application security, key management or others can be added if needed.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Security requirements have been specified.

#### Identity and Access Management (Optional)

*Guide:*

*The requirements for identity and access control. This section describes any requirements for authentication, identity management, single-sign-on, and necessary integrations to retained customer systems (e.g. corporate directories).*
- *Is there any Single Sign On or Active Directory Integration Requirement?*
- *Is the OS hardened if so please share the hardening guideline.*

#### Data Security (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Capture any specific or special requirements for data security. This section should also describe any additional constraints such as a requirement for data to be held in a specific location or for data export restrictions.*

### Networking Requirements

*Guide*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for networking-related topics. You can use the networking questions in the [Annex](#networking-requirement-considerations)*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Networking requirements have been specified.

### Integration and Interfaces (Optional)

*Guide:*

*A list of all the interfaces into and out of the defined Workload. The list should detail the type of integration, the type of connectivity required (e.g. VPN, VPC, etc.) the volumes, and the frequency.*
- *list of integrations*
- *list of user interfaces*

*                | Source    	| Target	  | Protocol  | Function
:---		                |:---		    |:---		  |:---		  |:---
IOT		                    | FieExample:*

Name	    ld Sensor	| MQTT Server | MQTT	  | Data collection
ELT	                       	| ODI		    | EBS DB	  | SQL Net	  | Data extraction
General Ledger Integration  | EBS           | ERP Cloud   | Batch     | Batch extraction
Mobile API                  | Mobile User   | HR Cloud    | Rest API  | Via API Cloud

### System Configuration Control Lifecycle (Optional)

*Guide:*

*This section should detail the requirements for the development and deployment lifecycle across the Workload. This details how code will be deployed and how consistency across the environments will be maintained over future software deployment. This may include a need for CI/CD.*
- *Will a CI/CD tool need access to deploy to the target environment*
- *Does the customer require software to be delivered to a repository*
- *How will configuration and software be promoted through the environments*


### Operating Model (Optional)

*Guide:*

*This section captures requirements on how the system will be managed after implementation and migration. In the vast majority of cases, the solution will be handed back to the customer (or the customer's SI/partner), but in some cases, Oracle may also take on some sustaining responsibilities through ACS or OC.*

*Also, capture requirements for tools to monitor and manage the solution.*

### Management and Monitoring (Optional)

*Guide:*

*This subsection captures any requirements for integrations into the customer's existing management and monitoring systems - e.g. system monitoring, systems management, etc. Also, if the customer requires new management or monitor capabilities, these should be recorded.*

*Example:*

Tool		            | Task				     | Target		    | Location   	    | New   | Notes
:---			        |:---					 |:---		        |:---		        |:---	|:---
Splunk		            | Log Data Consolidation | All targets	    | On-Prem           | No	|
Enterprise Manager		| Manage DB Instances    | All Oracle DBs	| OCI	(Migration) | No	|

### Performance (Optional)

*Guide:*

*The performance requirements cover all aspects related to the time required to perform a given operation. They can be measured in different ways, for example: (1) AvrgTime: average response time that can be accepted for a given online or real interaction (data retrieve, data insert, etc.) (2) MaxTime: maximum response time for the same operations defined for AvrgRtime The operations can be online (user interactions), offline (batch execution) or (near)realtime (messaging).*

*Example:*

Type		| Operation				 | KPI		| Unit	| Value	  | Notes
:---		|:---					 |:---	    |:---	|:---	  |:---
Online		| Retrieve customer data | MaxTime	| sec	| 3		  |
Online		| Retrieve customer data | AvrgTime	| sec	| 0.2	  |
Realtime|	| Receive MQTT message	 | AvrgTime	| msec	| 100	  | From arrival at Internet router

### Capacity (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Capacity is a measure of the total workload the system can bear without affecting performance. There are many KPIs to measure capacity, depending on the system's functionalities. Some of the most relevant KPIs are:*
- *MaxVol: maximum volume of data that can be stored in the system (can be different for different types of data, e.g. relational and file): 800-900GB current database size (probably with a significant waste of space)*
- *MaxFlow: maximum data flow (input/output) that can be managed by the system (can be two different numbers for each major system interface and/or operation): the current value has not been measured but is expected to be at most a few GB.*
- *MaxUser: maximum number of concurrent users (can be differentiated by user profile): up to 10 (number of registered users).*

*Example:*

System      | Capacity                | KPI		  | Unit   | Value    | Notes
:---		|:---					  |:---		  |:---	   |:---	  |:---
DB server	| DB size                 | MaxVol	  | GB     | 2000	  |
ETL Server  | Data processed nightly  | MaxFlow	  | GB/h   | 100	  |
OAC Server  | Simultaneous users      | MaxUsers  | -	   | 10	      |

## Constraints and Risks (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Constraints are limitations that will impact the resulting project or Solution Architecture. It is a technology- or project-related condition or event that prevents the project from fully delivering the ideal solution to customers and end-users. Constraints can be identified on our customer, partner, or even Oracle's side.*

*A project risk is an uncertain event that may or may not occur during a project.*

*Describe constraints and risks affecting the Workload and possible Logical Solution Architecture. These can be technical, but might also be non-technical. Consider budgets, timing, preferred technologies, skills in the customer organization, location, etc.*

*Example:*

Name                | Description                                                               | Type        | Impact               | Mitigation Approach
:---                |:---                                                                       |:---         |:---                  |:---
OCI skills          | Limited OCI skills in customers organization                              | Risk        | No Operating Model   | Involve Ops partner, for example, Oracle ACS
Team Availability   | A certain person is only available on Friday CET time zone                | Constraint  |                      | Arrange meetings to fit that person's availability
Access Restriction  | We are not allowed to access a certain tenancy without customer presence  | Constraint  |                      | Invite customer key person to implementation sessions

## Current State Architecture (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Provide a high-level logical description of the Workload's current state. Stay in the Workload scope, and show potential integrations, but do not try to create a full customer landscape. Use architecture diagrams to visualize the current state. I recommend not putting lists of technical resources or dependencies here. Refer to the attachments instead.*

## Future State Architecture

*Guide:*

*The Workload Future State Architecture can be described in various forms. In the easiest case, we describe a Logical Architecture, possibly with a System Context Diagram. A high-level physical architecture is mandatory as a description of your solution.*

*This should be the final architecture as part of the pre-sales solution, not an intermediate or draft version*

*Additional architectures, in the subsections, can be used to describe needs for specific workloads.*

This section describes the future state logical and physical deployment architecture of the Essbase application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and also lists the environments.

| Environment | Description                                                                                                 |

### Mandatory Security Best Practices

*Guide:*

*Use this text for every engagement. Do not change. Aligned with the Cloud Adoption Framework*

The safety of the ${doc.customer.name}'s OCI environment and data is the ${doc.customer.name}’s priority.
To following table of OCI Security Best Practices lists the recommended topics to provide a secure foundation for every OCI implementation. It applies to new and existing tenancies and should be implemented before the Workload defined in this document will be implemented.
Workload-related security requirements and settings like tenancy structure, groups, and permissions are defined in the respective chapters.
Any deviations from these recommendations needed for the scope of this document will be documented in chapters below. They must be approved by ${doc.customer.name}.

The customer is responsible for implementing, managing, and maintaining all listed topics.


Category  |Topic   |Details
--|---|--
| User Management          | IAM Default Domain        | Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) should be enabled and enforced for every non-federated OCI user account.                                                                                           |

# Naming Convention
*Guide:*

*This chapter describes naming convention best practices and usually does not require any changes. If changes are required please refer to [Landing Zone GitHub](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones). The naming convention zone needs to be described in the Solution Design by the service provider.*

*Use this template ONLY for new cloud deployments and remove it for brownfield deployments.*

A naming convention is an important part of any deployment to ensure consistency, governance, and security within your tenancy. Find [here](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/commons/resource_naming_conventions.md) Oracle's recommended best practices.

### OCI Landing Zone Solution Definition

*Guide:*

*This chapter describes landing zone best practices and usually does not require any changes. If changes are required please refer to [Landing Zone GitHub](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones). The full landing zone needs to be described in the Solution Design by the service provider.*

*Use this template ONLY for new cloud deployments and remove it for brownfield deployments.*

An OCI Landing Zone sets the foundations for a secure tenancy, providing design best practices and operational control over OCI resources. A Landing Zone also simplifies the onboarding of workloads and teams, with clear patterns for network isolation and segregation of duties in the organization, which sets the cloud operating model for day two operations.

Oracle highly recommends the use of an OCI Landing Zone for any deployment. Use these [guidelines](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/commons/lz_solution_definition.md) to set up your OCI Landing Zone, including design considerations, approaches, and solutions to use.

Note that all workloads in a tenancy should sit on top of a Landing Zone, meaning that the workload architecture defined in the next section can be subject to adjustments (e.g., network structure) towards the landing zone model, along with other future workloads.  

### Functional Architecture (Optional)

*Guide:*

*Provide a brief description of the functional architecture, split into two main areas: application capabilities and data.*

### Logical Architecture

*Guide:*

*Provide a high-level logical Oracle solution for the complete Workload. Indicate Oracle products as abstract groups, and not as physical detailed instances. Create an architecture diagram following the latest notation and describe the solution.*

*To implement a solution the Physical Architecture is needed in the next chapter. The physical notation can show individual components with physical attributes such as IP addresses, hostnames, or sizes.*

*[The Oracle Cloud Notation, OCI Architecture Diagram Toolkits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)*

Example:

Based on the customer requirements, the future state logical architecture of Essbase on OCI is depicted below.

![Future Logical Architecture](images/essbase-architecture-logical.png)

The main building blocks that compose this cloud architecture:

* __Essbase 21c__: The targeted version of Essbase on OCI will be Essbase 21C (21.3). Essbase 21c will be deployed via Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace.

* Database for Essbase metadata: Autonomous Database using the __Autonomous Transaction Processing workload__ (ATP). ATP is proposed to evaluate exclusive functionalities for federated partitions. ATP is a managed database integrated with Object Storage and optimized for analytical queries. Federated partitions enable integration of Essbase cubes with Autonomous Data Warehouse, to combine Essbase's analytical power with the benefits of the Autonomous Database.


### Physical Architecture

*Guide:*

*The Workload Architecture is typically described in a physical form. This should include all solution components. You do not have to provide solution build or deployment details such as IP addresses.*

*Please describe the solution as a written text. If you have certain specifics you like to explain, you can also use the Solution Consideration chapter to describe the details there.*

*[The Oracle Cloud Notation, OCI Architecture Diagram Toolkits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)*

# Security Guidelines

## Oracle Security, Identity, and Compliance

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is designed to protect customer workloads with a security-first approach across compute, network, and storage – down to the hardware. It’s complemented by essential security services to provide the required levels of security for your most business-critical workloads.

- [Security Strategy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security-strategy.htm) – To create a successful security strategy and architecture for your deployments on OCI, it's helpful to understand Oracle's security principles and the OCI security services landscape.
- The [security pillar capabilities](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security.htm#capabilities) pillar capabilities reflect fundamental security principles for architecture, deployment, and maintenance. The best practices in the security pillar help your organization to define a secure cloud architecture, identify and implement the right security controls, and monitor and prevent issues such as configuration drift.

### References

- The Best Practices Framework for OCI provides architectural guidance about how to build OCI services in a secure fashion, based on recommendations in the [Best practices framework for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-best-practices).

## Compliance and Regulations

Cloud computing is fundamentally different from traditionally on-premises computing. In the traditional model, organizations are typically in full control of their technology infrastructure located on-premises (e.g., physical control of the hardware, and full control over the technology stack in production). In the cloud, organizations leverage resources and practices that are under the control of the cloud service provider, while still retaining some control and responsibility over other components of their IT solution. As a result, managing security and privacy in the cloud is often a shared responsibility between the cloud customer and the cloud service provider. The distribution of responsibilities between the cloud service provider and customer also varies based on the nature of the cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
