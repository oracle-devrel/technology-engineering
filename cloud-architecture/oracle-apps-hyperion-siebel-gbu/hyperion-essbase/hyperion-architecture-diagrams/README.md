# Cloud Architecture Diagrams for Hyperion Deployments on OCI

This repository contains a set of Cloud Architecture Diagrams designed specifically for Hyperion deployments on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

These diagrams are created with draw.io, software for designing professional diagrams and flowcharts. They are stored in draw.io format and are fully editable.

They serve as a helpful resource for defining solutions, preparing designs, understanding service integrations, and visualizing data flows. These diagrams can be used by developers, solution architects, or anyone interested in designing and understanding Hyperion deployments on OCI.

For a more professional and consistent presentation, these diagrams use the official OCI icon pack for draw.io. You can download the icons pack from the official Oracle page [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)
