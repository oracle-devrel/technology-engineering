# Oracle ERP Apps Architecture

This ERP Architecture Group is focused on helping customers migrate on-premises ERP applications as there are EBS, JDE, PeopleSoft, to migrate these to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure  
On top of a Migration to OCI, there might be a reason during this migration to upgrade one or both, the Application and or the Database Release to a higher version, so the customer can benefit to become more current with recent releases.
During or after the migration, we can also add more value to your choice with a migration & modernisation to Oracle Cloud.
