# Oracle ERP Applications

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers a suite of migration, provisioning, and management tools for key Oracle “Apps Unlimited” applications, such as E-Business Suite, JD Edwards, and PeopleSoft. This makes it easy for customers to migrate their back-office applications and leverage immediate benefits, and also to incrementally optimize the applications and derive greater value over time with new integrations to other applications and new user experiences, such as digital assistants, improved data preparation, and visualization.

We believe that these assets will help our Partners/Managed Service Providers/Consulting Services to expedite the migration process to OCI.
