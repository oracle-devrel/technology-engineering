## Prepare the OCI Tenancy

### Single Run

You can run the assessment as a member of the OCI `Administrator` group or
create a group for auditing and assign the respective user to it.

Running the assessment script as an OCI `Administrator` is the easiest and
quickest way. If you decide to use this option, please continue reading in
[Run the OCI Security Health Check in Cloud Shell](files/oci-security-health-check-standard/README.md#run-the-oci-security-health-check-in-cloud-shell).

### Recurring usage

For recurring usage, setting up a group for auditing is recommended. For setting this up follow the steps documented next.

### Setting up an *Auditor* group and policy

Using an auditor group is the recommended way to run the assessment script.
To create a group for auditing do the following steps:

  - Log into OCI Console as OCI administrator.
  - In your Default domain create a group `grp-auditors`
  - Create a policy `pcy-auditing` with these statements (if your tenancy does not have Domains, replace `'Default'/'grp-auditors'` with `grp-auditors`):
    ```
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to inspect all-resources in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read instances in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read load-balancers in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read buckets in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read nat-gateways in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read public-ips in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read file-family in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read instance-configurations in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read network-security-groups in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read resource-availability in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read audit-events in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read users in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read vss-family in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to read dns in tenancy
      allow group 'Default'/'grp-auditors' to use cloud-shell in tenancy
    ```
  - Assign a user to the `grp-auditors` group.
  - Log out of the OCI Console.

## Run the OCI Security Health Check in OCI Cloud Shell

For a detailed description go to [Run the OCI Security Health Check in OCI Cloud Shell](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/security/security-design/oci-security-health-check-standard/files/oci-security-health-check-standard/README.md#run-the-oci-security-health-check-in-cloud-shell)

## Sample Output

After a completed run you will find a directory with a name starting with your tenancy name followed by a timestamp in your working directory (like `tenancy_name_YYYYMMDDHHmmss_standard`). A zip archive for easier download using the same name will be created, too. Both hold data files for your review.

To start with reviewing the results, open the file named [cis_html_summary_report.html](files/resources/cis_html_summary_report.html)(sample report).
