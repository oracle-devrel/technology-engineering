Use this asset to set up KVM as a Bring Your Own Hypervisor (BYOH) on OCI Compute

- This [document](https://github.com/mariusscholtz/Oracle-Cloud-Infrastructure-resources/tree/main/kvm) will explain how to install and use Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) on Bare Metal on OCI. The host operating system for KVM will be Oracle Linux 9. Once KVM is setup, we will create guest VMs. The main purpose of this document is to show how easy and quickly to provision a KVM Host.
