# Deploying Ollama and Open WebUI on OKE

In this tutorial, we will explain how to use a Mistral AI large language model (LLM) in a browser using the Open WebUI graphical interface. The LLM will be served using the Ollama framework and the overall infrastructure will rely on an Oracle Kubernetes Engine cluster with a NVIDIA A10 GPU based node pool.

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial, you will need:
* An OCI tenancy with limits set for A10 based instances 

## Deploying the infrastructure

### Creating the OKE cluster with a CPU node pool

The first step consists in creating a Kubernetes cluster. Initially, the cluster will be configured with a CPU node pool only. GPU node pool will be added afterwards.

</p>

The easiest way is to use the Quick Create cluster assistant with the following options:
* Public Endpoint,
* Self-Managed nodes,
* Private workers,
* VM.Standard.E5.Flex compute shapes,
* Oracle Linux OKE specific image.

### Accessing the cluster

Click Access Cluster, choose Cloud Shell Access or Local Access and follow the instructions. If you select Local Access, you must first install and configure the [OCI CLI package](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm). We can now check that the nodes are there:
```
kubectl get nodes
```

### Adding a GPU node pool

Once the cluster is available, we can add a GPU node pool. Go to `Node pools` on the left panel and click on `Add node pool` and use the following options:
* Public endpoint,
* Self-Managed Nodes,
* VM.GPU.A10.1 nodes,
* Oracle Linux GPU OKE image.
* Specify a custom boot volume size of 250 GB and add an Initialization script (Advanced options) to apply the changes.
```
#!/bin/bash
curl --fail -H "Authorization: Bearer Oracle" -L0 http://169.254.169.254/opc/v2/instance/metadata/oke_init_script | base64 --decode >/var/run/oke-init.sh
bash /usr/libexec/oci-growfs -y
bash /var/run/oke-init.sh
```
Click on Create to add the GPU instances and wait for the node pool to be `Active` and the nodes to be in the `Ready` state. Check again the nodes that are available:
```
kubectl get nodes
```
Check device visibility on the GPU node whose name is `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`:
```
kubectl describe nodes xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx | grep gpu
```
You will get the following output:
```
                    nvidia.com/gpu=true
Taints:             nvidia.com/gpu=present:NoSchedule
  nvidia.com/gpu:     1
  nvidia.com/gpu:     1
  kube-system                 nvidia-gpu-device-plugin-8ktcj    50m (0%)      50m (0%)    200Mi (0%)       200Mi (0%)     4m48s
  nvidia.com/gpu     0           0
```

### Installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator

You can access the cluster either using Cloud Shell or using a standalone instance. The NVIDIA GPU Operator enhances the GPU features visibility in Kubernetes. The easiest way to install it is to use `Helm` ([Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)).
```
helm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia
helm repo update
helm install gpu-operator nvidia/gpu-operator --namespace gpu-operator --create-namespace
```
Check again the device visibility on the GPU node:
```
kubectl describe nodes xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx | grep gpu
```
You will get the following output:
```
                    nvidia.com/gpu=true
                    nvidia.com/gpu-driver-upgrade-state=upgrade-done

## Deploying Ollama

### Creating Ollama deployment

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is an open source framework for deploying and training language models on a local machine such as a cloud instance. To deploy Ollama, simply use the `ollama-deployment.yml` manifest.
```
kubectl apply -f ollama-deployment.yaml
```
Check that the deployment is ready:
```
kubectl get all
```

### Pulling the model from pod

The `ollama` image does not come with any models. Therefore, it is necessary to download it manually. Enter the container:
```
kubectl exec -ti ollama-deployment-pod -- /bin/bash
```
where `ollama-deployment-pod` is the name of the pod displayed by the `kubectl get pods` command.
Pull the desired model(s), here Mistral 7B version 0.3, simply referred to as `mistral`:
```
ollama pull mistral
```
For more model options, the list of all supported models can be found in [here](https://ollama.com/search).

Optionnally, the model can be tested from the container:
```
ollama run mistral

```
Exit the container by simply typing `exit`.


### Creating an Ollama service

A Service is necessary to make the model accessible from outside of the node. The Ollama (load balancer with a public IP address) service can be created using the `ollama-service.yaml` manifest:
```
kubectl apply -f ollama-service.yaml
```

## Deploying Open WebUI

### Creating Open WebUI deployment

Open WebUI is a user-friendly self-hosted AI platform that supports multiple LLM runners including Ollama. It can be deployed using the `openwebui-deployment.yaml` manifest. First set the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` value in the manifest and apply it:
```
kubectl apply -f openwebui-deployment.yaml
```

### Creating Open WebUI service

Like Ollama, OpenWebUI requires a Service (load balancer with a public IP address) to be reached. The Open WebUI service can be created using the `openwebui-service.yaml` manifest:
```
kubectl apply -f openwebui-service.yaml
```

## Testing the platform

An easy way to check that everything is running is to run the following command:
```
kubectl get all
```
Go to `http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:81` where XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is the external IP address of the Open WebUI load balancer and click on `Get started` and create admin account (local).

If no model can be found, go to `Profile > Settings > Admin Settings > Connections > Manage Ollama API Connections` and verify that the Ollama address matches the Ollama service load balancer external IP address and check the connection by clicking on the `Configure icon > Verify Connection`.

You can now start chatting with the model.

## Deleting the platform

If you want to delete all the platform, first delete all the resources deployed in the OKE cluster:
```
kubectl delete all --all
```
Then, the OKE cluster can be deleted from the OCI console.
