# Full Stack Disaster Recovery with OCI CLI for a Cold Standby Topology
 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Full Stack Disaster Recovery (Full Stack DR) provides a fully automated and comprehensive disaster recovery orchestration solution for all the layers of a full-stack cloud application, including infrastructure, database, and application. Using Full Stack DR, you can recover your full stack applications across OCI regions, or across availability domains within the same region.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Command Line Interface (OCI CLI) is a small-footprint tool that you can use on its own or with the Oracle Cloud Console to complete Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tasks. The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides the same core functionality as the Oracle Cloud Console, plus additional commands. Some of these, such as the ability to run scripts, extend Console functionality.

The CLI is built on the OCI SDK for Python and runs on Mac, Windows, or Linux. The Python code makes calls to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure APIs to provide the functionality implemented for the various services. These are REST APIs that use HTTPS requests and responses.
