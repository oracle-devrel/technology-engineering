# Workload Migration to OCI – Comprehensive Guide

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a global cloud services platform that delivers a broad portfolio of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and DaaS capabilities across distributed data centers. It empowers enterprises to run virtual machines, containers, databases, AI/ML workloads, storage, networking, and VMware environments at scale with high performance, security, and flexibility.

This document provides a technical overview of migration methodologies and tooling, including VMware HCX, RackWare, and Oracle Cloud Migrations (OCM) — the primary solutions used to migrate workloads from both VMware and non-VMware environments into OCI. It outlines key requirements, tool capabilities, architectural approaches, and decision criteria to help organizations execute large-scale migrations efficiently and with minimal disruption.
