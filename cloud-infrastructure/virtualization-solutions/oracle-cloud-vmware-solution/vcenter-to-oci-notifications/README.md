# Oracle Cloud VMware Solution - vCenter Alarm integration with OCI Notifications

This script enables integration between vCenter alarms and the OCI Notifications service. By forwarding vCenter alarms to OCI Notifications, you can more easily manage who receives notifications and choose from multiple notification protocols (such as email, Slack, custom webhooks, or PagerDuty) supported by OCI. This simplifies recipient management and extends the reach of your alerts beyond the vCenter infrastructure.
