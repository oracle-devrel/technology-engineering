**Project-specific assumptions**



- Oracle Secure Desktop (OCM) supports Bring Your Own License (BYOL) for Windows virtual machines, but the support may vary depending on the specific version of Windows being migrated and the licensing agreements in place.

- OCI Windows Server Images can be used with OCI Secure Desktop as custom images, but charges will be applicable.

- For certain versions of Windows, customers may be able to migrate to dedicated virtual machine hosts on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to enable BYOL.

- Dedicated VM hosts provide physical servers dedicated to a single customer's use, offering enhanced control and security.

- Customers should review their licensing agreements and consult with Oracle support or their Oracle account representative to determine the specific options available for migrating Windows virtual machines to OCI with BYOL.

- Customers should ensure compliance with licensing requirements to avoid any potential issues.

### Obligations
