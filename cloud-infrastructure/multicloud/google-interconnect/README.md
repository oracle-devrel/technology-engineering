# Oracle - Google Cross-Cloud Interconnect

Oracle and Google Cloud announced a partnership that gives customers the choice to combine Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Google Cloud technologies to help accelerate their application migrations and modernization. 

Enterprises can seamlessly connect Google Cloud services, such as analytics and AI, to Oracle Cloud services, such as Exadata and Autonomous Database. For organizations seeking to optimize and elevate their cloud infrastructure capabilities and commercial calculus, such a native multicloud model offers the best-of-both-clouds customer experience that encompasses a unified and interoperable technical and commercial stack.

Google Cloud’s Cross-Cloud Interconnect will be initially available for customer onboarding in 11 global regions, allowing customers to deploy general purpose workloads with no cross-cloud data transfer charges.
