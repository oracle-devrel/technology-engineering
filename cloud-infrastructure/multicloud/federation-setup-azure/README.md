# OCI Implementation Series: Multicloud Federation Setup (Azure) and Solution Efficiency with JIT

Multicloud is a cloud computing strategy that incorporates the best services from more than one public cloud provider to deploy a solution. This enables customers to meet diverse business requirements and ensure they are choosing the best cloud provider for each workload, based on capabilities, requirements, and performance.

With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) being one of the leading cloud platforms, organizations often find themselves in the position of utilizing OCI services along with at least one other cloud provider to meet their business requirements.

But as organizations adopt multicloud strategies, the need to seamlessly integrate and manage resources across multiple cloud providers can become a challenge. One of the critical issues faced by enterprises in a multicloud environment, is managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) across multiple cloud platforms.

## When to use this asset?

A multicloud IAM solution simplifies administration and plays a vital role in ensuring secure access to resources, controlling permissions and maintaining compliance. Oracle Cloud Lift Services has implemented solutions that address these challenges for various enterprise customers in multicloud environment setup.
