# OCI Implementation Series: Integrate Okta IAM with OCI Identity Domain in Hybrid Cloud Environment Setup

As organizations increasingly adopt multi-cloud and hybrid cloud infrastructures, managing identity and access across multiple environments can become a complex and challenging task. Traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions often struggle to keep up with the evolving cloud landscape, leaving organizations vulnerable to security breaches and compliance issues.

A multi-cloud/hybrid cloud IAM solution offers a comprehensive approach to managing identities, access, and security across multiple environments. By providing a centralized platform that can manage access to multiple cloud services and applications, a multi-cloud/hybrid cloud IAM solution simplifies IAM administration and strengthens security. Oracle Cloud Lift Services has implemented solutions that address these challenges.
