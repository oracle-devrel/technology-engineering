# OSSA Checklist

OSSA stands for 'Oracle Software Security Assurance', which encompasses the security measures taken by Oracle to ensure the safety of its software solutions. It's important to note that security is an ongoing process, so we continuously update and improve our OSSA checklist to uphold the highest standards of security.

CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure
baseline configuration for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure environment. The scope of this benchmark is to
establish a base level of security for anyone utilizing the included Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Current OSSA checklist is aligned with the CIS OCI Benchmark 1.2.0
