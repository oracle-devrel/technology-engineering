# Oracle Cloud Guard Instance Security
 
Instance Security provides runtime security for workloads in Compute virtual and bare metal hosts. Instance Security expands Cloud Guard from cloud security posture management to cloud workload protection. It ensures that security needs are met in one place with consistent visibility and holistic understanding of the security state of infrastructure.

Instance Security collects important security information about compute hosts such as security alerts (called problems in Cloud Guard), vulnerabilities, and open ports to provide you with actionable guidance for detection and prevention. You can detect suspicious processes, open port creation, and script execution for workloads, with OS level visibility. Instance Security provides new Oracle-managed ready-to-use detections and the customer managed queries for threat hunting use cases.

Instance Security is natively integrated with OCI Logging so you can easily export logs to your third-party security tooling.
