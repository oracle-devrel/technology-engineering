# Network Visualizer Assets

The Network Visualizer provides a diagram of the implemented topology of all VCNs in a selected region and tenancy. This tool in the OCI Console can provide two levels of granularity:

- Regional Network Topology: You can see a high-level layout and routing topology of your entire virtual network configuration within a region. This topology includes DRGs, VCNs, CPEs, and various types of gateway.
- Virtual Cloud Network Topology: You can see the organization of a single VCN including its subnets and routing configuration. This topology includes subnets, VLANs, and gateways to other resources.
- Subnet Topology: You can see the resource information about the instances, load balancer, FSS, and OKE clusters in the subnet
- Generate a .pdf with all component details and diagrams
