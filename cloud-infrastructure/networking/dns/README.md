# OCI DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed internet system that maps human-readable names (such as Oracle.com) to IP addresses and serves as the first link in the customers’ digital supply chain. Oracle’s globally distributed DNS service offers enhanced DNS performance, resiliency, and scalability so that end users connect to customers’ applications as quickly as possible from wherever they are.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Domain Name System (DNS) service lets you create and manage your DNS zones. You can create zones, add records to zones, and allow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's edge network to handle your domain's DNS queries. 

We do have three major components around DNS: Private DNS, Public DNS, and Traffic Management.
