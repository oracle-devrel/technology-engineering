#  Inter Region Latency

The Inter-Region Latency dashboard in the Console provides the average network round-trip latency (round-trip time or RTT) for all pairs of regions  in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure realm, the dashboard shows a current snapshot view and lets you view historic snapshots including up to a 30-day history.

The Inter-Region Latency dashboard shows two charts:

    The Current Inter-Region Round-Trip Time is a current snapshot expressed in milliseconds. This snapshot is an average of values over the last five minutes. This view updates every minute.
    The Inter-Region Round-Trip Time (ms) for the last 30 days is a historical view of the last 30 days
