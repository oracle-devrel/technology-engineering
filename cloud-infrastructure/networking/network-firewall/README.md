# Network Firewall Assets
Enterprise customers leverage next-generation network firewall solutions to protect on-prem apps against layer 3-7 cyber attacks. We need to provide a similar network security posture to enable those customers to adopt and migrate their workloads to OCI.

- Layered Defence
- Advanced Egress Security Controls
- Advanced Network Firewall Features
