# Networking Gateways
 
Internet Gateway (IGW) is an optional gateway you can add to your VCN to enable direct connectivity to the internet

NAT Gateway(NAT) gives to your VCN  instances in a private subnet access to the internet

Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)  to connect to customer on-prem DC or other OCI regions
DRG instances support following attachment types:
    VCNs
    Remote Peering Connections
    Site-to-Site VPN IPSec tunnels
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect Virtual Circuits
    
 Service Gateway (SGW)  lets resources in your VCN privately access specific Oracle services, without exposing the data to an internet gateway or NAT
