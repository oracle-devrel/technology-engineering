# Networking Gateways
 
Internet Gateway (IGW) is an optional gateway you can add to your VCN to enable direct connectivity to the internet.

NAT Gateway(NAT) gives your VCN  instances in a private subnet access to the internet.

Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)  to connect to customer on-prem DC or other OCI regions.

DRG instances support the following attachment types:
    
 - VCNs
 - Remote Peering Connections
 - Site-to-Site VPN IPSec tunnels
 - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect Virtual Circuits
    
 Service Gateway (SGW)  lets resources in your VCN privately access specific Oracle services, without exposing the data to an internet gateway or NAT.
