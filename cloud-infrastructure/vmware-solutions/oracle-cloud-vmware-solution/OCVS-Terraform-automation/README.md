# Oracle Cloud VMware Solution - Terraform Automation

Terraform can be used both to provision and manage an OCVS environment. In the folders in this directory 
you will find examples for various scenarios:

- Provisioning OCVS through terraform (3 different scenarios are included)
- Adding an ESXi host to a multi-ad deployment, with the option to specify it's AD location
- Manage OCVS (2-day operations), creating a new VLAN and attaching it to the OCVS environment
