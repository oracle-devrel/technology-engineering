# When to use this asset?
 
Use this asset as an example, when you have OAuth enabled in ORDS and you want to decouple the client authentication in API Gateway from the ORDS native mechanism, by using a different Identity Provider (IdP) or a different authentication mechanism. This example is using IDCS as Identity Provider for the client authentication. You can adapt to use any OAuth compliant IdP.
