# OCI API Management

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a comprehensive set of services to manage the lifecycle of APIs.

**Oracle API Gateway** is a highly available virtual network appliance that can receive API calls at scale and route them to back-end services, such as Serverless Functions, services running on Oracle Kubernetes Engine, Oracle Integration, ORDS and more.

Developers can choose from a wide range of tools to create API descriptions in OpenAPI format which is supported by OCI API Gateway.

API Gateway provides policy enforcement such as limit the number of requests sent to back-end services, enable CORS, provide authentication and authorization, add mTLS support, modify incoming requests and outgoing responses, cache responses to improve performance and reduce load on back-end services.

API managers can create Usage Plans within API Gateway and define API access tiers. API teams can monitor the traffic and analytics of their APIs based on the usage plan and subscriptions. This enables customers to analyze usage patterns as well as unlock new revenue streams by monetizing APIs.
