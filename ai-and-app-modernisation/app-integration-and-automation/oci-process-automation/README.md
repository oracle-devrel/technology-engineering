# OCI Process Automation

Oracle Process Automation (OPA) capabilities help business and IT groups within enterprises to implement business process initiatives that aim at automating business transactions that usually involve people and systems of record. Users can build, customize and change process applications in a collaborative manner using a Low Code 100% browser-based declarative environment. 

There are two working environments: the design-time environment, where you develop and test applications, and the runtime environment, where you use and monitor process applications: Structured Processes and Dynamic Processes.
