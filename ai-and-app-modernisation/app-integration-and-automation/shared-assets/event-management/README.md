# Event Management (Choreography)
 
This pattern addresses 2 main problems (to split under 2 different patterns and / or subpatterns is under evaluation):
1. Complexity and volume of information to be shared across applications and systems is raising together with need to get updated information as soon as it is available (near real-time). Also methods to manage information flow seem too rigid and should achieve greater agility (from Orchestration to Choreography)
2. Systems managing information/transactions are not open enough to publish information updates (events).
   

Examples of topics could be:
* Generallyspeaking:needtopropagateinformationfromsourcesystemstotargetonesassoonastheyareupdated (near real time approach)
* APortal/Webapplicationwhichneedsasynchronousupdatesonsourceinformationlikeorderactivation,shipment status, etc.
