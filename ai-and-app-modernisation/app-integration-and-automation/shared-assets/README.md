## Architecture Center

- [Enable multicloud integrations from Oracle Cloud ERP to Microsoft Azure SQL Database](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-multicloud-erp-azure/index.html)
    - Reference Architecture on the Oracle Architecture Center, which provides the necessary considerations and recommendations to enable a multicloud, event-driven, and no-code integration solution to receive real-time feeds from Oracle Cloud ERP and send those to a private Microsoft Azure SQL Database, leveraging a component Oracle Integration provides called the connectivity agent, to facilitate on-premises/multicloud integrations
- [Implement message-level encryption in Oracle Integration Cloud using OCI Vault](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oic-message-level-encryption/index.html#GUID-5C843938-A470-4584-9048-4361025358C6)
    - Message-level encryption (MLE) is a security technique used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of a message during transmission. It involves using encryption algorithms to scramble the contents of a message so that only the intended recipient, with the decryption keys, can read it. This reference architecture shows how you can implement message-level encryption in OIC using OCI Vault Service.
