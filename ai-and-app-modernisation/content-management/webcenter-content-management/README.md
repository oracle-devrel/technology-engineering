# WebCenter Content Management

Oracle WebCenter Content provides a single content management platform that helps companies consolidate assets with a unified set of tools. It enables organizations with a unified repository to house unstructured content and deliver it to business users in the proper format, and within context of familiar applications to fit the way they work.

Oracle WebCenter Content manages content that can include documents, email, electronic discussions, images, videos, and other types of digital information.

Oracle WebCenter Content Server is the foundation for a variety of Oracle content management features. It provides a flexible, secure, centralized, web-based repository that manages all phases of the content life cycle from creation and approval to publishing, searching, expiration, and archiving or disposition
