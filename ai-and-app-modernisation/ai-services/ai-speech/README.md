# AI Speech

OCI Speech is an AI service that applies automatic speech recognition technology to transform audio-based content into text. Developers can easily make API calls to integrate OCI Speechâ€™s pre-trained models into their applications. OCI Speech can be used for accurate, text-normalized, time-stamped transcription via the console and REST APIs as well as command-line interfaces or SDKs. You can also use OCI Speech in an OCI Data Science notebook session. With OCI Speech, you can filter profanities, get confidence scores for both single words and complete transcriptions, and more.
