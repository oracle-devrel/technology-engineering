# Workload Requirements and Architecture

## Overview
<!--
Role  | RACI
------|-----
ACE   | R/A
Impl. | None
PPM   | None
-->

*Guide:*

*Describe the Workload: What applications and environments are part of this Workload migration or new implementation project, and what are their names? The implementation will be scoped later and can be a subset of the Solution Definition and proposed overall solution. For example, a Workload could exist of two applications, but the implementer would only include one environment of one application. The workload chapter is about the whole Workload and the implementation scope will be described later in the chapter [Solution Scope](#solution-scope).*

## Non-Functional Requirements
<!--
Role  | RACI
------|-----
ACE   | R/A
Impl. | None
PPM   | None
-->

*Guide:*

*Describe the high-level technical requirements for the Workload. Consider all sub-chapters, but decide and choose which Non-Functional Requirements are necessary for your engagement. You might not need to capture all requirements for all sub-chapters.*

*This chapter is for describing customer-specific requirements (needs), not to explain Oracle solutions or capabilities.*

### Regulations and Compliances Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures specific regulatory or compliance requirements for the Workload. These may limit the types of technologies that can be used and may drive some architectural decisions.*

*The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compliance Documents service lets you view and download compliance documents:
https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ComplianceDocuments/Concepts/compliancedocsoverview.htm*

*If there are none, then please state it. Leave the second sentence as a default in the document.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Regulatory and Compliance requirements have been specified.

In addition to these requirements, the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundation Benchmark, v1.2](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/Oracle_Cloud) will be applied to the Customer tenancy.

### Environments

*Guide:*

*A diagram or list detailing all the required environments (e.g. development, text, live, production, etc.).*

*If you like to describe a current state, you can use or add the chapter 'Current Sate Architecture' before the 'Future State Architecture'.*


Example:

Name	        | Size of Prod  | Location	  | DR    | Scope
:---		    |:---		   	|:---		  |:---   |:---
Production      | 100%        	| Malaga	  | Yes   | Not in Scope / On-prem
DR              | 50%           | Sevilla     | No    | Workload
Dev & Test      | 25%           | Sevilla     | No    | Workload - ${doc.config.impl.type}


### High Availability and Disaster Recovery Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures the resilience and recovery requirements for the Workload. Note that these may be different from the current system.*

*The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirement of each environment should be captured in the environments section above, and wherever possible.*

- *What are the RTO and RPO requirements of the Application?*
- *What are the SLAs of the application?*
- *What are the backup requirements*

*Note that if needed, this section may also include an overview of the proposed backup and disaster recovery proposed architectures.*

*This chapter is mandatory, while there could be no requirements on HA/DR, please mention that in a short single sentence.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Resilience or Recovery requirements have been specified.

### Security Requirements

*Guide:*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for security-related topics. The requirements can be (but don't have to be) separated into:*
- *Identity and Access Management*
- *Data Security*

*Other security topics, such as network security, application security, key management, or others can be added if needed.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Security requirements have been specified.

### Networking Requirements

*Guide*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for networking-related topics. You can use the networking questions in the [Annex](#networking-requirement-considerations)*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Networking requirements have been specified.

## Future State Architecture
<!--
Role  | RACI
------|-----
ACE   | R/A
Impl. | None
PPM   | None
-->

*Guide:*

*The Workload Future State Architecture can be described in various forms. In the easiest case, we describe a Logical Architecture, possibly with a System Context Diagram. A high-level physical architecture is mandatory as a description of your solution.*

*This should be the final architecture as part of the pre-sales solution, not an intermediate or draft version*

*Additional architectures, in the subsections, can be used to describe needs for specific workloads.*

### Mandatory Security Best Practices

*Guide:*

*Use this text for every engagement. Do not change. Aligned with the Cloud Adoption Framework*

```{.snippet}
sec-best-practices
```

### Naming Conventions

*Guide:*

*This chapter describes naming convention best practices and usually does not require any changes. If changes are required please refer to [Landing Zone GitHub](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones). The naming convention zone needs to be described in the Solution Design by the service provider.*

*Use this template ONLY for new cloud deployments and remove it for brownfield deployments.*

```{.snippet}
ar-naming-convention
```

### OCI Landing Zone Solution Definition

*Guide:*

*This chapter describes landing zone best practices and usually does not require any changes. If changes are required please refer to [Landing Zone GitHub](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones). The full landing zone needs to be described in the Solution Design by the service provider.*

*Use this template ONLY for new cloud deployments and remove it for brownfield deployments.*

```{.snippet}

```

### Logical Architecture
<!--
Role  | RACI
------|-----
ACE   | R/A
Impl. | None
PPM   | None
-->

*Guide:*

*Provide a high-level logical Oracle solution for the complete Workload. Indicate Oracle products as abstract groups, and not as physical detailed instances. Create an architecture diagram following the latest notation and describe the solution.*

*To implement a solution the Physical Architecture is needed in the next chapter. The physical notation can show individual components with physical attributes such as IP addresses, hostnames, or sizes.*

*[The Oracle Cloud Notation, OCI Architecture Diagram Toolkits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)*

### Physical Architecture
<!--
Role  | RACI
------|-----
ACE   | R/A
Impl. | None
PPM   | None
-->

*Guide:*

*The Workload Architecture is typically described in a physical form. This should include all solution components. You do not have to provide solution build or deployment details such as IP addresses.*

*Please describe the solution with an architecture image plus a written text. If you have certain specifics you like to explain, you can also use the Solution Consideration chapter to describe the details there.*

*[The Oracle Cloud Notation, OCI Architecture Diagram Toolkits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)*

## Sizing and Bill of Materials
<!--
Price Lists and SKUs / Part Numbers: https://esource.oraclecorp.com/sites/eSource/ESRCHome
-->

*Guide:*

*Estimate and size the physically needed resources of the Workload. The information can be collected and is based upon previously gathered capacities, business user numbers, integration points, or translated existing on-premises resources. The sizing is possibly done with or even without a Physical Architecture. It is okay to make assumptions and to clearly state them!*

*Clarify with sales your assumptions and your sizing. Get your sales to finalize the BoM with discounts or other sales calculations. Review the final BoM and ensure the sales are using the correct product SKUs / Part Number.*

*Even if the BoM and sizing were done with the help of Excel between the different teams, ensure that this chapter includes or links to the final BoM as well.*

*WIP*
- *Revision of existing discovery templates*
- *Consolidated data gathering sheet (sizing focused)*
- *Workload-specific sizing process/methodology*

### Assumptions
<!--
Role  | RACI
------|-----
ACE   | R/A
Impl. | R
PPM   | None
-->

*Guide:*

*List any assumptions, if any, which could impact the solution architecture or the implementation.*

*Example:*

**Generic assumptions**
- It is assumed that all required contractual agreements between Oracle and the Customer are in place to ensure uninterrupted execution of the project.
- It is assumed that all work will be done remotely and within either central European time or India Standard Time normal office working hours.
- It is assumed that upgrades are excluded from the scope of work and no production systems/production cutover is part of the scope of work undertaken by the Oracle Service
- It is assumed that all required Oracle cloud technical resources are available for use during the duration of the project and that engineers involved have been granted the appropriate access to those technical resources by the customer before the start of the project.
- It is assumed that all required customer resources, and if applicable third-party resources, are available during the duration of the project to work openly and collaboratively to realize the project goals uninterruptedly.
- It is assumed that all required customer resources, and if applicable third-party resources are aware of all technical and non-technical details of the as-is and to-be components. All resources are committed to technical work as far as is needed for the execution of the project.
- It is assumed that all required documentation, system details, and access needed for the execution of the project can be given/granted to parties involved when and where deemed needed for the success of the project.
- It is assumed that the customer will have adequate licenses for all the products that may/will be used during the project and that appropriate support contracts for those products are in place where the customer will take the responsibility of managing any potential service request towards a support organization to seek resolution of a problem.
- It is assumed the customer will provide the appropriate level of information and guidance on rules and regulations which can directly and/or indirectly influence the project or the resulting deliverables. This includes, however not limited to, customer-specific naming conventions, security implementation requirements, internal SLA requirements as well as details for legal and regulatory compliance. It will be the responsibility of the customer to ensure that the solution will adhere to this.
- It is assumed that under the customer's responsibility, the customer will ensure and validate that the solution will be placed under the proper controls for ensuring business continuity, system availability, recoverability, security control, and monitoring and management as part of a post-project task.
- It is assumed that the customer will take responsibility for testing all functional and non-functional parts of the solution within the provided timeline and ensure a proper test report will be shared with the full team (including customer, Oracle, and if applicable third party).
- It is assumed that any requirement, deliverable, or expectation that is not clearly defined as in-scope of the project will not be handled as part of the project and is placed under the responsibility of the customer to be handled outside of the project.

**Project-specific assumptions**
- It is assumed that sufficient network bandwidth (greater than 200 GB) is available between OCI and Customer onPremise for any data transfer.
- It is assumed that the customer, or a partner of your choice, will own the control, access, management, and further development of your OCI environment following the deployment of your solution.

### Obligations
<!--
Role  | RACI
------|-----
ACE   | R/A
Impl. | R
PPM   | None
-->

*Guide:*

*List any obligations required by the customer to perform or have available, if any, which could impact the architecture or the implementation. Please always include this chapter to capture the obligation that we have admin access to the customer's tenancy.*

*Example:*

- You will have purchased the appropriate Universal Credits for the services required for the project.
- The implementation team will have admin access to the customer's tenancy for implementation.
- You will ensure the appropriate product training has been obtained to maintain and support the implementation
- Your business team will be available for the Testing phase, which will be completed within the agreed testing window.
- You will provide project management for the project and will manage any third-party suppliers or vendors.
- You will provide the implementation team with appropriate access to your tenancy & relevant on-premises applications/database to perform implementation activities. We recommend the least-privilege access principle.
- You will revoke implementor access on production goLive or after project completion.
- You will take consistent and restorable backups of your existing data and application before implementation.

**Add for EBS migration**
- Your on-premise source non-prod environment would be a fresh clone from the production environment for easy simulation of issues.
- You would be responsible for applying and testing all migration-related patches on the on-premise source environment.
- You will ensure that the relevant pre-requisite patches have been applied on the on-premise source environment as per MOS DocID 2517025.1: Getting Started with Oracle E-Business Suite on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure:
   * Table 5 - Source Environment Requirements with Target Database Tier on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute VM (Under 4.2.2 section) and
