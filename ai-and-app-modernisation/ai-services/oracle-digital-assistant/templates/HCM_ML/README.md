# Oracle Digital Assistant HCM Multi Language (HCM_ML) Template
 
The HCM-ML Template is a quick start to easily add multi language and Q&A to the HCM out-of-the-box skill.
The provided documentations describes an entry-level exercise to start working with Oracle Digital Assistant using the HCM_ML template as a starting point to use the HCM SaaS skill in a multi-lingual way.

Background
  Oracle Digital Assistant is an environment for building digital assistants, which are user interfaces driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that help users accomplish a variety of tasks in natural language conversations. Digital assistants consist of one or more skills, which are individual chatbots that are focused on specific types of tasks.
  In this lab, you will create a Multilingual HCM bot with Q&A based on the HCM_ML template. This bot will be able to:
    1. Answer questions based on the users data in Oracle Fusion HCM
    2. Answer generic questions (Q&A)

Scope
  The HCM_ML template contains a subset of the HCM SaaS skill as a starting point:
    1. Absence balance
    2. Find co-worker details
    3. Payslip information
  See the HCM Skill Documentation Excel sheet (in zipfile) with all intents and the ones (high) already created Arabic translations for as an example.

What do you need?
  1. Access to a paired Oracle Digital Assistant Fusion instance linked to a Universal Credits instance (see ODApaired.pdf)
  2. This document (HCM_ML template.pdf)
  3. The concierge template (ConciergeTemplate.zip)
  All the required assets are part of the zip file downloaded from GitHub.

Disclaimer
  This is a description of an ODA template. The instruction and the example code are just examples and should be seen as a starting point of a HCM ODA skill with multi-language support. For the latest documentation on Oracle Digital Assistant always check oracle.com.
