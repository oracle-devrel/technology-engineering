# GenAI-based Procurement Q&A App using Text-to-SQL and Low-Code Integration

In this article, we'll explore how to make a handy tool that helps to enable real-time purchase order feeds into a procurement DB store and also to transform procurement queries in natural language to SQL Queries and synthesize the SQL Response using Oracle Generative AI, Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) and Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB). 
This application combines a low-code approach to orchestrate LLM AI services and applications using Oracle Integration Cloud
and Generative AI prompting techniques for tasks like text-to-SQL transformations.
