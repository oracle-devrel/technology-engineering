# Generative AI service
 
Oracle’s AI strategy is to make artificial intelligence (AI) pervasive across its cloud applications and cloud infrastructure. We serve business users who want to improve business processes and outcomes through prebuilt AI capabilities, data scientists and developers who want complete control to build and deploy AI models of any kind, and independent software vendors (ISVs) who want the most performant and cost-effective platform to host their AI services.
