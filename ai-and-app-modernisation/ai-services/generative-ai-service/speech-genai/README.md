# Transcribe and summarize speech-to-text
 
OCI Speech is an AI service that applies automatic speech recognition technology to transform audio-based content into text.  Generative AI, The Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the text input and can generate, summarize, transform, and extract information. Using these AI capabilities, we built a low code application- â€œIntegrate OCI AI Speech Service and Generative AI Service for Summarization in Visual Builder "  to invoke AI Speech REST API to convert audio files into text and then further invoke the Generative AI REST API to Summarize it.
