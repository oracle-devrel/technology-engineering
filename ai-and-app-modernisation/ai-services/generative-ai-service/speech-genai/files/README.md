# Integrate OCI AI Speech Service and Generative AI Summarization in Visual Builder

# Introduction

OCI Speech is an AI service that applies automatic speech recognition technology to transform audio-based content into text.  Generative AI, The Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the text input and can generate, summarize, transform, and extract information. Using these AI capabilities, we built a low code application- "Integrate OCI AI Speech Service and Generative AI Summarization in Visual Builder"  to invoke AI Speech REST API to convert audio files into text and then further invoke the Generative AI REST API to Summarize it.

# Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have access to these services:

- Oracle Speech Service
- Oracle Generative AI Service
- Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service
- Oracle Visual Builder Service Connection

# AI Speech and OCI Generative AI Service Integration Architecture

1. AI Speech App using VBCS

- Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service (VBCS) is a hosted environment for your application development infrastructure. It provides an open-source standards-based development service to create, collaborate on, and deploy applications within Oracle Cloud. This application is developed in VBCS.

2.	Transcriptions with OCI AI Speech Service:
- Speech harnesses the power of spoken language enabling you to easily convert media files containing human speech into highly exact text transcriptions.
- Produces accurate and easy-to-use JSON and SubRip Subtitle (SRT) files written directly to the Object Storage bucket you choose.

3.	Integration with OCI Generative AI Service:
- The transcriptions (text) are sent to the OCI Generative AI Service for text summarization.

4.	Integration with OCI AI Vision and OCI Generative AI Service using Visual Builder Service Endpoint:
- Build a Service Connection Endpoint option is used to integrate the VBCS app and OCI Object Storage, OCI AI Speech Service, and Generative AI Summarization.

5.	Summarization Process:
- OCI Generative AI Service generates text using the keywords received from OCI Speech service, to create a concise summary of the audio or video.

# Application Flow in Detail (VBCS, OCI Speech, OCI Generative AI Service)

In this application, the drag-and-drop component in VBCS allows the user to drop the audio or video. 
- Create a Service Endpoint connection in Visual Builder to handle the communication between Visual Builder and OCI Speech Service.
- Pass the selected audio or video from Visual Builder to OCI Speech Service to convert it into text.
- OCI Speech Service analyzes the media (audio or video) file and converts it into text.
- The OCI Speech Service returns the transcription to the AI Speech Service Endpoint and returns the results to the Visual Builder app.
- The transcription further passes to the Generative AI Service Endpoint and returns the Summarization results to the Visual Builder app.

# Service Endpoint call - Invoke OCI Object Storage

      uploadfile - /n/{namespaceName}/b/{bucketName}/o/{objectName}
      getObject - /n/{namespaceName}/b/{bucketName}/o/{outputFolderName}/{outputObjectName}


# Service Endpoint call - Invoke AI Speech Service 

      create transcription - /transcriptionJobs
      get transcription - transcriptionJobs/{transcriptionJobId}

# Service Endpoint call - Invoke Generative AI Service

      create summary - /20231130/actions/summarizeText


# Conclusion

In this article, we've covered how to utilize Oracle AI Speech Service features to provide a transcription and summarize using Generative AI service.
