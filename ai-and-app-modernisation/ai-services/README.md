# AI Services
 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI Services is a collection of services with prebuilt machine learning models that make it easier for developers to apply AI to applications and business operations. The models can be custom-trained for more accurate business results. Teams within an organization can reuse the models, datasets, and data labels across services. OCI AI Services makes it possible for developers to easily add machine learning to apps without slowing down application development.
