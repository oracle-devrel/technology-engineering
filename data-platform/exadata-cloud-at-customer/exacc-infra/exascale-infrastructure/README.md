Exascale Infrastructure got announced early July, 2024 for Oracle Exadata Database Service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Please see the public links for more information below.

# Key points of Exascale

- [Exascale requires Oracle Database 23ai.]
- [It is replacing ASM as our disk management solution for Exacale environments and can coexists with ASM based environments within the same physical infrastructure.] 
- [It is using three way mirroring for data redundancy, so usable capacity will be the same as with ASM based environments.]
- [Virtual Machine file systems are hosted in the Exascale Vault as well, which means, that those are no on the local disks in the Database servers anymore.]
