# Exadata Cloud@Customer VM Serial Console History and Cloud Shell Integration

Announcing the General Availability (GA) of Serial Console History and Cloud Shell Integration for Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer. These features expand upon the functionality of the serial console access features that we had announced previously. With these new features, customers can easily connect to the serial console of their VMs in order to perform corrective actions and can review/audit previous activities carried out via the serial console by users.

# Key Benefits
These features automate certain common administrative tasks related to the usage of the VM serial console for simplicity and convenience, saving precious time and reducing guesswork for our users.

# Console History
Customers can now conveniently audit administrative activities undertaken via the serial console. The console history information is available directly from the OCI console by any tenancy user who has been granted the proper permissions. This will simplify auditing and allow customers to easily comply with internal security audit policies.

# Cloud Shell integration
Cloud Shell integration for the serial console allows users who have been granted proper permissions to easily connect to the VM Serial Console directly from the OCI Cloud Shell. This feature simplifies access and eliminates the need for a user to connect from their local system via SSH to OCI. Some customers have network policies that block such access without granting exceptions. Now, with OCI Cloud Shell integration, customers can easily connect "at-a-click" from the OCI Console without having to work around any networking restrictions manually.
