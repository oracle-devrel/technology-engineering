# Analytical Data Platform
 
Oracle's [Data Platform](https://www.oracle.com/data-platform/) delivers a complete, open, and intelligent platform to cater to all analytical workloads from the largest lakehouses to the smallest data marts, from a cloud data warehouse to a distributed data mesh; it delivers these workloads at scale and with enterprise-grade security and performance to tackle the most demanding data workloads.

### Architecture Center
 
- [Data platform - data lakehouse](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/data-platform-lakehouse/index.html#GUID-A328ACEF-30B8-4595-B86F-F27B512744DF)
    - This reference architecture describes a lakehouse architecture pattern, the services that are part of it, the capabilities those services deliver, and how to deploy them. It covers best practices, a deployment topology, and also automated deployment with an Oracle Resource Manager Terraform stack.
- [Deploy a machine learning model close to the network edge](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/deploy-ml-at-edge/#GUID-8EC86246-D724-4C16-8073-8CB5B2EA6719)
    - This reference architecture describes a deployment where data is ingested from edge locations into OCI, where it is used to build and train ML models that are deployed in the edge for low latency inferencing.

### GitHub

  - Blog post describing how to organize and govern a data lake that supports several business domains in an OCI tenancy, maintaining segregation between domains while ensuring those domains have the flexibility and agility to maintain their cloud resources to produce data products.
- [Decentralized Data Lake on OCI Object Storage (Part 2)](https://jakubillner.github.io/2023/02/19/data-lake-on-oci-object-storage-2.html)
  - Blog post describing how to organize and govern a decentralized data lake domains and entities in an OCI tenancy with a design that explains 1) how to store lake data with partitions, 2) how those can be implemented, 3) governed by a Data Catalog and then 4) consumed seamlessly by ADW in a cohesive and integrated lakehouse architecture.
- [Automated Load and Export Pipelines in Autonomous Database](https://jakubillner.github.io/2023/03/27/adb-data-pipelines.html)
  - Blog post on how to ingest automatically data residing in Object Storage to make it available in ADW for further processing and curation. Covers as well the export of ADW data to Object Storage that can be used for several purposes, including ILM, offloading data sharing to Object Storage, or making data available via the data lake.
