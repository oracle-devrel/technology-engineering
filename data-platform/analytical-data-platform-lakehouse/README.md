# Analytical Data Platform
 
Oracle's [Data Platform](https://www.oracle.com/data-platform/) delivers a complete, open, and intelligent platform to cater to all analytical workloads from the largest lakehouses to the smallest data marts, from a cloud data warehouse to a distributed data mesh; it delivers these workloads at scale and with enterprise-grade security and performance to tackle the most demanding data workloads.
