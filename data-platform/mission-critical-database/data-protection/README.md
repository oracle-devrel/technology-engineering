Encompasses Data Protection best practices using Oracle Technologies and Cloud Services.

This section covers ZDLRA, ZFS, Recovery Service, and Backup Service

Oracle Database Zero Data Loss Autonomous Recovery Service is a fully managed data protection service for Oracle Databases running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Unique, automated capabilities protect Oracle Database changes in real-time, validate backups without production database overhead, and enable fast, predictable recovery to any point in time. Low costs based on the amount of data being protected mean that zero data loss resiliency is available to organizations of any size and virtually any budget.

Oracle Database Backup Cloud Service is a secure, scalable, on-demand storage solution for backing up Oracle databases to Oracle Cloud. The service complements your existing backup strategy by providing an off-site storage location in the public cloud.
To use Oracle Database Backup Cloud Service you’ll subscribe to the service, install the Oracle Database Cloud Backup Module, and configure your environment to send backups to the cloud. You can then use familiar Recovery Manager (RMAN) commands to perform backup, restore, recovery, and maintenance operations. You can also use other tools for your cloud backups.
