# Oracle Forms To Apex Modernization

This section covers Oracle Forms to APEX Modernization topic.

APEX is the ideal technology for modernizing applications developed in Oracle Forms. It is a Low-Code tool, data-centric, and enables the creation of reports and forms straightforwardly. Furthermore, it comes at no additional cost as it is included in the Oracle database licenses.

Modernization of Forms, and not Migration from Forms to APEX, should be the correct way to discuss transitioning from Forms to APEX as the migration process is not
always straightforward and in many cases involves a coexistence of both technologies for a given time.
