# SQLcl and Liquibase
Reviewed: "05.01.2024"

[Oracle SQLcl (SQL Developer Command Line)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/sql-developer-command-line/index.html) is a Java-based command line interface for Oracle Database. Using SQLcl, you can execute SQL and PL/SQL statements in interactive or batch mode

[Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) is an open-source database-independent library for tracking, managing and applying database schema changes. This feature, is included in the standalone SQLcl offering, which is different that the SQL Developer installation.
 
## The Liquibase Feature in SQLcl
The Liquibase feature in SQLcl enables you to execute commands to generate a changelog for a single object or for a full schema (changeset and changelogs). You can process these objects manually using SQLcl or through any of the traditional Liquibase interfaces.
