# SQL Repository

Welcome to the SQL repository of the Data Development team at Oracle. This repository is designed to provide comprehensive resources, tips, and tools to help you master SQL and leverage the latest features of Oracle23ai.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows you to perform a variety of operations such as querying data, updating records, creating and modifying schema, and controlling access to the database. It is a crucial skill for data developers and analysts, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation to support data-driven decision-making.

PL/SQL, the Oracle procedural extension of SQL, is a portable, high-performance transaction-processing language. PL/SQL offers several advantages over other programming languages: from being tightly integrated with SQL to leveraging High Performance and High Productivity. PL/SQL is a portable and scalable Procedural Language which also increase Manageability and support for Object Oriented Programming. 

Below you'll find an index to all the sections available in this repository, along with a brief introduction to what you can expect in each section.
