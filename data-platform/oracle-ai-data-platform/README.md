# Oracle AI Data Platform
 
Oracle AI Data Platform provides streamlined, secure, and seamless data management,
analysis, and collaboration.
Oracle AI Data Platform is designed for enterprises that need to:
• Streamline Data Discovery and Governance: AI Data Platform provides a centralized
metadata repository (Master Catalog) that enhances searchability and governance of
structured and unstructured data.
• Enable Secure Data Collaboration: Through RBAC-based access control, AI Data
Platform allows different teams to work on shared datasets while maintaining strict security
policies.
• Accelerate Data Preparation and Processing: With built-in notebooks and workflow
orchestration, users can clean, transform, and enrich data efficiently.
• Support Advanced Analytics and AI/ML: AI Data Platform integrates with Apache Spark,
allowing data scientists and analysts to run complex computations and model training
directly within their data lake.
• Ensure Seamless Integration Across Data Sources: AI Data Platform supports external
catalogs from Autonomous Database (ADB), Object Storage (OS), and third-party data
sources, enabling users to query and analyze data without duplication.
