# SQL Performance Analyzer

SQL Performance Analyzer (SPA) as part of Real Application Testing focuses on detailed statement analysis of a defined SQL workload made available via a SQL Tuning Set (STS). The workload runs twice - once BEFORE the change and then AFTER the change. The resulting reports are a detailed comparative analysis (before and after the change) of the individual statements, measured by different metrics such as elapsed time, CPU time, etc. Optionally, you can automate the tuning process using SQL Tuning Advisor or SQL Plan Baselines.
