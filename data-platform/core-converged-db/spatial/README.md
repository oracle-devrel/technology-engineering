# Spatial

Oracle Spatial, often referred to as Spatial, is designed to make spatial data management easier and more natural to users of location-enabled applications and geographic information system 
(GIS) applications. Once spatial data is stored in an Oracle database, it can be easily manipulated, retrieved, and related to all other data stored in the database.

With spatial features included for free with all editions and services of Oracle Database, you can store, manage, process, and analyze all forms of spatial workloads and data sets. You can create maps to visualize and interact with your data. 

You can use the free tool Spatial Studio, to a visualize, explore, and analyze geospatial data stored in and managed by Oracle Spatial. Spatial Studio is a multiuser Java EE application that can be used as a standalone tool (Quick Start) or deployed to WebLogic Server.
