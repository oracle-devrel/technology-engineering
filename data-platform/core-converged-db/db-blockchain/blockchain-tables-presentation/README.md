Blockchain tables are insert-only tables that organize rows into a number of system chains. Blockchain and Immutable tables are part of the Crypto-Secure Data Management features in Oracle 19c and later releases. Rows in a blockchain table are made tamper-resistant by special sequencing and chaining algorithms.
