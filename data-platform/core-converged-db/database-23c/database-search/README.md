# Database Search

Oracle Text is a full-text search that is fully integrated into Oracle Database and delivered as a part of all versions of Oracle Database. It uses standard SQL to index, search, and analyze text and documents in different stored in the Oracle database, in files, and on the web. 

Oracle Text can perform linguistic analysis on documents, mining capabilities, classification, clustering, etc.

In 23 Ubiquitous Database Search helps in cases where you need to search in different data sources. Only one command is needed to create a self-managed index and another one to add different sources. Without writing additional PL/SQL code you can include different table data sources in your search. A new simple PL/SQL interface called DBMS_SEARCH to create an index across multiple objects, easily add data sources (specific tables or views) into the index or also remove them. This strongly simplifies indexing tasks. 

For example, it is not necessary to define complex USER_DATASTORE procedures. In addition, the synchronization of the index will be maintained automatically.
