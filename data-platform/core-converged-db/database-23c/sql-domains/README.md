# SQL Domains

A SQL domain (also called usage domain or domain) is a dictionary object that belongs to a schema and encapsulates a set of optional properties and constraints for common values. After you define a SQL domain, you can define table columns to be associated with that domain, thereby explicitly applying the domain's optional properties and constraints to those columns. SQL domains are used to provide additional information to a stored column (JSON or relational), and therefore, used to define and validate data.

Oracle's SQL domain implementation provides a wider range of functions than the one specified in the SQL standard (see Part 2 Foundation (SQL Foundation)).
