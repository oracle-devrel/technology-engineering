# Annotations

 Annotations (also called application usage annotations) are optional property metadata for database objects. They are centrally stored in the database, so that you can share metadata information across applications, modules, and microservices. You can use them to customize the business logic and the user interfaces or provide information about your database objects to your metadata repositories.

 Annotations are supported for the database objects such as tables and table columns, views and view columns, materialized views and materialized view columns, indexes, and also for domains and multi-column domain columns.

 An annotation is either a name-value pair or a name by itself. The name is mandatory, the value optional and both can be provided as freeform text fields. Annotations can be generated with CREATE or ALTER statements.
