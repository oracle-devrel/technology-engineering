# Generic Multitenant Workshop

This workshop was designed to provide a HOL experience on the Multitenant option core features. Built on a 21c database on IaaS, it gives an excellent practical experience on the following topics:

- Agile PDB provisioning: create, unplug/plug, refreshable PDB, snap clone
- Manage nay as one: backup/restore, flashback
- Application containers
- Database users and resource management

This workshop is meant to be delivered in 2h30-3h: during the first 30min, a quick overview presentation reminds the core concepts that will be covered by the lab.
Then the lab will allow the participants to work on each concept by running scripts and commands, following the user's guide.
