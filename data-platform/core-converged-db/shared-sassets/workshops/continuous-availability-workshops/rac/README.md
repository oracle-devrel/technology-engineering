# Real Application Clusters Workshop

The Real Application Clusters option has been around since Oracle 9i, leveraging High Availability as well as extreme scalability at the database level.

This workshop provides practical knowledge about managing a RAC database for continuous availability. It takes advantage of the newest features like Application Continuity (AC) and Transparent Application Continuity (TAC), or features like Fast Application Notification (FAN).

Built on a 19c database on DBCS, it gives an excellent practical experience on the following topics:

- Create service on your RAC database: create services for AC and TAC
- Demonstrate Application Continuity with a Java application: run the application in NOREPLAY, AC, and TAC mode
- Use FAN on the DB servers
- Demonstrate client-side FAN events

This content is meant to be delivered as a workshop in 3 hours, a 30-minute introduction and 2h30 Hands-on.
