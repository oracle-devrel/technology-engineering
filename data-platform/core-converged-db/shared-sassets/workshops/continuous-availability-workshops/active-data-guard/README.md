# Active Data Guard Workshop

The Active Data Guard option is the complement to RAC, addressing Disaster Recovery requirements.

Transparent Application Continuity will protect your application in Active Data Guard scenarios. Along with that, the Fast Start Failover (FSFO) feature allows the building of robust architectures, where the decision to fail over another location is delegated to the database itself. Failover will occur automatically under certain configurable circumstances, leveraging unattended disaster recovery at the database level.

This workshop provides practical knowledge about managing an Active Data Guard configuration for continuous availability. It takes advantage of the newest features like Transparent Application Continuity (TAC), or features like Fast Start Failover. Built on a 19c database on DBCS, with 3 21c observers on IaaS, it gives an excellent practical experience on the following topics:

- Configure and use Data Guard Broker
- Demonstrate Transparent Application Continuity, Active Data Guard
- Create a Fast Start Failover configuration with a primary database, an active standby database and 3 observers
- Resilience tests with FSFO and observers

This content is meant to be delivered as a workshop in 3 hours, a 30-minute introduction and 2h30 Hands-on.
