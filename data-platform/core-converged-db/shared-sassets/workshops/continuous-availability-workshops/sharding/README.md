# Sharding Workshop

The Sharding option, from 12.2 onward, allows you to build an Oracle database with a NoSQL-like architecture. This leverages important concepts like extreme scalability, data sovereignty, and extreme resilience.

This workshop gives very useful practical knowledge about managing a sharded database. Built on a 19c database on IaaS, it gives an excellent practical experience on the following topics:

- Become familiar with the sharded database architecture components: shard catalog, shard director and shards
- Deploy a sharded database
- Create a non-sharded application, and migrate it to the sharded database
- Setup and run a demo application
- Demonstrate Database requests routing to shards
- Demonstrate Sharded database dynamic scaling

This content is meant to be delivered as a workshop in 3 hours, a 30-minute introduction and 2h30 Hands-on.
