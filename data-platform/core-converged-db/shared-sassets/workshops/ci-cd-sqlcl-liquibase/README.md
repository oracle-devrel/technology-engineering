# CI/CD Workshop

CI/CD in the context of the Oracle database is a concern among Oracle's customers.
Chances are if you’ve worked in a development process, at some point or another you’ve had to deal with the need for:

- Frequent delivery and updates
- Changing requirements and specifications, sometimes even late in the development process
- And no matter the situation, if you aren’t creating quality products that people enjoy using and bring them value, all your work is for nothing

With Liquibase and SQLcl, CI/CD automation for Oracle Database is made easier.

Build on two 23c free databases on Docker containers, this workshop gives an excellent practical experience on the following topics:

- Capture a full database schema with Liquibase on the Dev environment
- Update a GitHub repository
- Apply the changes to the target environment
- Demonstrate incremental updates
- Demonstrate rollback

This content is meant to be delivered either as a demo or a workshop in 1h30, a 30-minute introduction and 1-hour Hands-on.
