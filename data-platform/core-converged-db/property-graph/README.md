# Property Graph

Property Graph of Oracle Database offers powerful graph support for the Oracle Database, to explore and discover complex relationships in data sets such as customer data, social networks, and financial transactions, for applications in product recommendation, fraud detection, risk analysis, targeted marketing, and more. This high-performance Graph feature delivers advanced graph query language support, developer APIs, and analytics capabilities with nearly 60 pre-built algorithms.
Property Graph including the PGQL (Property Graph Query Language) support is available from Oracle Database 12.2 onward. Starting from Oracle Database 23, you can also create and query property graphs using SQL, as defined in the SQL:2023 standard.

Oracle Graph Server and Client is a software package that works with the Property Graph feature in the Oracle Database. It includes graph tools, client libraries, and Oracle Graph Server for running graph analytics algorithms. Oracle Graph Server and Client releases four times a year and its release version number is not related to the Oracle Database Release version number.
