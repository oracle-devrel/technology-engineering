# Real Application Clusters Workshop

The Real Application Clusters option has been around since Oracle 9i, leveraging High Availability as well as extreme scalability at database level.
This workshops gives very useful practical knowledge about managing a RAC database for continuous availability, taking advantage of the newest features like Application Continuity (AC) and Transparent Application Continuity (TAC), or the not so new but often not well known features like Fast Application Notification (FAN).
Build on a 19c database on DBCS, it gives an excellent pratical experience on the following topics:

- Create service on your RAC database: create services for AC and TAC
- Demonstrate Application Continuity with a Java application: run the application in NOREPLAY, AC, and TAC mode
- Use FAN on the DB servers
- Demonstrate client side FAN events

This content is meant to be delivered as a workshop in 3h, a 30mn introduction and 2h30 Hands-on-Lab.
