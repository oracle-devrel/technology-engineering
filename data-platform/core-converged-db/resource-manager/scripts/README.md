# How to use this asset?

Run the scripts.

The following scripts help to monitor the setup:
- monitorplan.sql: to monitor the resource plan
- monitorgroup.sql: to monitor the resource group for a user (e.g. after a switch)
- cpu_sess.sql: to monitor resource manager statistics per session
- cpu_user.sql: to display CPU related data for currently active resource consumer groups
- cpu_dop_sess.sql: to display CPU and DOP related data for currently active resource consumer groups
- activeplan.sql: to display active plan and the history of active plans
- throttlingperconsumer.sql: to display information about resources consumed and wait times per consumer group.
Interesting fact: When STATISTICS_LEVEL is set to TYPICAL or ALL, this view contains information about CPU utilization and wait times even when no Resource Manager plan is set or when the Resource Manager plan does not monitor CPU or session resources. Metrics are collected and stored every minute when CPU utilization is not being monitored.

The following scripts helps to setup an environment:
- consumer.sql: to set up the consumer groups
- plan.sql: to set up the resource plan
- planon.sql: switch plan on
- planoff.sql: switch plan off
- removeplan.sql: to remove a resource plan

The foloowing scripts switch a plan or a group to another plan or group:
- switch_sess.sql: to switch a current session to raise or lower resources
- switch_user.sql: to switch a user
- switchplan.sql: to switch a plan

Scripts to test a plan:
- burn.sql: to create REDEF_USER and a program to burn CPU
- burns.sql: to run the script to burn CPU
