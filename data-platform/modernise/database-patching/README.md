# Database Patching
 
Oracle regularly makes patches available to upgrade features, enhance security or fix problems with the Oracle database software version which is under Support. Oracle Database Patching is the process of updating the binaries and database with newly released patches.

In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure the customer owns and manages patching of OS and Database components for Co-Managed Database Services (Oracle Base Database and Exadata Database Service - Dedicated) with the help of powerful automation available. OCI follows Release Update(RU) Patching Strategy (from 12.2 version) for Grid Infrastructure and Database Home of Co-Managed Database Services. For Autonomous Databases, Oracle owns and Manages Patching.

Best practices & other useful resources around how to patch Oracle Databases on premises or on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure can be found on this page.
