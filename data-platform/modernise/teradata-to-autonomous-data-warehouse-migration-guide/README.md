# Teradata to Autonomous Data Warehouse on OCI Migration Guide

## Why move Teradata to Autonomous Data Warehouse on OCI?

Legacy Data Warehouses, like Teradata, present a lot of inconveniences nowadays. The monolithic architecture implies high costs both in terms of hosting and management. Also, legacy Data Warehouses are difficult to scale (up/down, out/in) and require very skilled personnel to operate. The capex model associated costs and the costs associated to this expert personnel, among others, are making the companies to move the legacy database systems to the cloud rapidly. 

On the other hand, the Scalability and Elasticity, inherent in OCI, allows companies to scale the databases up or down based on the business needs and changing workloads.

Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) offers a flexible, scalable, highest performing, highly available, and secure data warehouse solution that fulfills all these operational and costs challenges. Easy management and automation and built-in disaster recovery tools are other advantages that ADW provides.

## Potential challenges & migration tool

The process of migrating from Teradata to OCI Autonomous Databases (like Autonomous Data Warehouses - ADW) presents a number of challenges that users will have to deal with, like differences in the implementation of structures, objects and data types, data extraction methods, data transformation requirements between the two platforms, data consistency and integrity, the final data loading, and more...

SQL Developer can assist this process by using its built-in functionalities and tools. Using SQL Developer in a migration can help to reduce the efforts, accelerate the whole process and reduce human errors.
