# Oracle Cloud Premigration Advisor Tool
 
Cloud Premigration Advisor Tool (CPAT) helps you evaluate an existing Oracle database for compatibility with Oracle Cloud Database Services including Autonomous Database. Using CPAT before migrating to OCI makes assessing your source database easier and faster!  CPAT removes much of the legwork of identifying potential user actions, prioritizing their importance, and suggesting resolutions. Oracle recommends using CPAT to accelerate your migration to Oracle Cloud.
