# Oracle Data Pump
 
Oracle Data Pump technology enables very high-speed movement of data and metadata from one database to another. Oracle Data Pump is available only on Oracle Database 10g release 1 (10.1) and later. Data Pump consists of two command-line clients and two PL/SQL packages. The command-line clients, expdp and impdp, provide an easy-to-use interface to the Data Pump export and import utilities. You can use expdp and impdp to export and import entire schemas or databases.

The Data Pump export utility writes the schema objects, including the tables and metadata that constitute mining models, to a dump file set. The Data Pump import utility retrieves the schema objects, including the model tables and metadata, from the dump file set and restores them in the target database.

A set of best practices and other useful assets/links can be found in this page.
