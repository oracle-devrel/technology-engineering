# When to use this asset?

In this asset we will explore how we can using the `oracledb` python SDK to interact with the Oracle Database 23ai EE with AI Vector Search Capabilities. We have created a table `simple_demo_cohere` within our Oracle Database and loaded 89 rows of sample text data into this table. Please refer to the SQL script `simple-demo-cohere-dataloading.sql` for the table creation and data loading statements which can be executed against our Oracle DB via SQLPlus or SQLDeveloper.

The following Notebook will go through reading in our sample data, then using the new Langchain integration to call the OCI Generative AI and perform Embeddings on top of text data utilising the `cohere.embbed-english.v3.0` model (we will pass each text as its own API embed call), and store the data back into our table via an update statement. We can then perform similarity search against our Vector DB to find the closest matched records based on our input data.
