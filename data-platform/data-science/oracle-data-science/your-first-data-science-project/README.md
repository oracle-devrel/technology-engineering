# Overview

Your First Data Science Project demonstrates how to build a complete end-to-end data science workflow using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science Platform.
The project walks through the main stages of a typical machine learning lifecycle — from data preparation to model deployment and inference — using practical examples.

# What You’ll Learn

This project covers the following steps:

Data ingestion

Data preprocessing and visualization

Model training and validation

Model explainability

Model deployment

Endpoint invocation for predictions

# Prerequisites

Access to OCI Data Science Platform

Basic familiarity with Python and machine learning concepts

A valid compartment, resource principal and policies configured for Data Science services. More details can be found in the Guide for Your First Data Science Project prerequisites.pdf

# How to Use

Open the provided notebook in your OCI Data Science Notebook Session.

Select the following conda environment: automlx234_p310_cpu_x86_64_v1

Run the notebook cells in sequence to reproduce the complete workflow.
