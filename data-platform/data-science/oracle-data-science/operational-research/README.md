# Overview

This project presents three operational research use cases with different levels of complexity:

1. **Finding the best route using Dijkstra’s algorithm** – the simplest use case.
2. **Flight scheduling using integer linear programming.**
3. **Individual pricing optimization with global and individual constraints** – an advanced use case that also showcases the use of different resources and features in the OCI Data Science Platform.
