# OCI PostgreSQL 

OCI Database with PostgreSQL is a fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible service with intelligent sizing, tuning, and high durability.

The service automatically scales storage as database tables are created and dropped, making management easier on you and optimizing storage spend. 
Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. 

OCI Database with PostgreSQL is designed for high availability by offering durability even in the event of an availability domain (AD) failure.
