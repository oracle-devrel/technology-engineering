# OCI Data Flow
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Flow is a fully managed Apache Spark service that performs processing tasks on extremely large datasets—without infrastructure to deploy or manage. Developers can also use Spark Streaming to perform cloud ETL on their continuously produced streaming data. This enables rapid application delivery because developers can focus on app development, not infrastructure management
