# OCI Data Flow
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Flow is a fully managed Apache Spark service that performs processing tasks on extremely large datasets—without infrastructure to deploy or manage. Developers can also use Spark Streaming to perform cloud ETL on their continuously produced streaming data. This enables rapid application delivery because developers can focus on app development, not infrastructure management

# Reusable Assets

- [Build and deploy OCI DataFlow application using OCI Data Science - Example](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/data-platform/open-source-data-platforms/oci-data-flow/code-examples/build-and-deploy-app-from-oci-ds)
When using OCI Data Science to build and deploy an OCI Data Flow application. Using the notebook sessions, you can either directly interact with an OCI Data Flow cluster in-line and test your Spark code, and afterwards easily deploy and run the OCI Data Flow application.

- [Load data from OCI Data Flow into Autonomous Database](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/data-platform/open-source-data-platforms/oci-data-flow/code-examples/load-data-to-adw)
When you are planning to use an Autonomous Database as a source and/or Autonomous Database as a target when running an OCI Data Flow application.

- [Connect to Salesforce using OCI Data Flow](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/data-platform/open-source-data-platforms/oci-data-flow/code-examples/connect-to-salesforce)
When you are looking to use Salesforce data in your OCI Data Flow application, you can use the script to establish the connection and query relevant Salesforce data.

- [Run OCI Data Flow from OCI Functions](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/data-platform/open-source-data-platforms/oci-data-flow/code-examples/run-from-functions)
When in your overall flow OCI Functions are used (e.g., based on an event) to start an OCI Data Flow job run.

- [Connect to AWS SR](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/data-platform/open-source-data-platforms/oci-data-flow/code-examples/connect-to-AWS-S3)
When you are using AWS S3 to store files and these files need to be processed in your OCI Data Flow application, you can use this file and extract the code snippet to establish the connection.

- [Connect to PostgreSQL](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/data-platform/open-source-data-platforms/oci-data-flow/code-examples/connect-to-postgresql)
When you are using PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data and you need to establish a connection between OCI Data Flow and you PostgreSQL instance.

- [Connect to Snowflake](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/data-platform/open-source-data-platforms/oci-data-flow/code-examples/connect-to-Snowflake)
When you are using Snowflake as your database and you need to establish a connection between OCI Data Flow and your Snowflake instance.
