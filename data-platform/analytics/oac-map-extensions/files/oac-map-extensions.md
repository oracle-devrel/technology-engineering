# Introduction

Oracle Analytics platform is a cloud native service that provides the capabilities required to address the entire analytics process including data ingestion and modeling, data preparation and enrichment, and visualization and collaboration, without compromising security and governance. Oracle Analytics Extensions expand and enhance your Oracle Analytics deployment with custom extensions to further your visualization capabilities.

Map Extension functionality can be used by Oracle Analytics Cloud consumers and business intelligence analysts. 

## Pre-requisites:

In order to enable this solution, the following must be available:

- Operating system (64 bits): Linux, Solaris x86-64, SPARC, Windows, AIX, HP-UX, Linux.
- Oracle Analytics Cloud: Enterprise Edition.
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Account: You will need an active Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account. 
- IAM User: You need to create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user in your OCI tenancy with the required permissions to access Oracle Cloud.
  
### Main Features:

- Report for Revenue Analysis.
- Custom Map Extension.
- JSON Files for different countries.

## Business Value
The customer is required to get their data columns modeled to be displayed on maps. They can configure the map data and then analyze it in map views.
Map views allow them to display data on maps in different formats and to interact with data. They can create maps to visualize data such as sales by city and country, and products purchased in a specific region, and determine where you might need to add sales resources.

## Use Case 

When a custom map extension is used, customers can visualize the data by countries/cities.
The custom map extension adds more value to the data by representing it from the least to the most ranges in different colors and highlighting meaningful insights. This solution shows how custom maps can be updated in the Oracle Analytics Cloud and used in a map graph representing revenue by country.

The implemented solution satisfies below functional requirements:

- Be able to do Revenue analysis.
- Visualize sales data.
- Drill down reports to sales by country and city.
- Product purchased in a specific region.
- Insights to highlight turnover performance by country.
- Represent Net profit by country/city.
