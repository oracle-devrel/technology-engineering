# Oracle Graph for Data Science

This page covers Oracle Graph analytics for Data Science projects.

Graph databases, part of Oracle’s converged database offering, eliminate the need to set up a separate database and move data. Analysts and developers can perform fraud detection in banking, find connections and links to data, and improve traceability in smart manufacturing, all while gaining enterprise-grade security, ease of data ingestion, and strong support for data workloads.
